[DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) project documenation and website source
code.

# Documentation

Documentation engine was built using React, react Markdown library, Algolia to
aprovide the full text search. Motivation for bulding it from scratch was lack of
flexibility (customization, sidebar tuning) and ads in engines like
readthedocs, docsify, etc.

Please, feel free to use it for your own sites and
[reach us out](https://dvc.org/support) if you have any questions.
