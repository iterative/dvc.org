[DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) project documentation and website source
code.

# Documentation

This docs engine was built using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) +
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/),
[react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown), and integrates with
[Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/products/search/) to provide full text search.
The motivation for building it from scratch was the lack of flexibility
(customization, sidebar tuning) and ads in sites like readthedocs, docsify, etc.

Please feel free to use it for your own sites and
[reach out to us](https://dvc.org/support) if you have any questions.
