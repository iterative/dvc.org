[DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) project documentation and website source
code.

# Documentation

Documentation engine was built using React, react Markdown library, Algolia to
provide the full text search. Motivation for building it from scratch was lack
of flexibility (customization, sidebar tuning) and ads in engines like
readthedocs, docsify, etc.

Please, feel free to use it for your own sites and
[reach out to us](https://dvc.org/support) if you have any questions.
