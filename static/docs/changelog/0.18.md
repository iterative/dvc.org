# v0.12 - v0.18

We have been working hard last few weeks improving **user experience**,
**performance**, and **documentation**. Kudos to `@sotte` and `@Hong-Xiang` for
the great feedback they gave us!

We are very close to the 1.0 release! Two major changes are coming in DVC 1.0 -
[commit semantics](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/919#issuecomment-414540094)
and
[execution matrix](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/973#issuecomment-412739728).
Both changes should make DVC more flexible for ML practitioners. Please, read,
discuss and let us know about your thoughts!

Since the last announcement we have released versions 0.12 through 0.18 and are
really excited to share the progress with you:

- ‚ö° **DVC just got faster**:

  - Data files management commands - `dvc add`, `dvc push`, `dvc pull`, etc got
    up to 10x faster on data sets with large number of files.

  - Commands startup latency reduced 3x

- üìô **Documentation got better** - a whole new [get started](/doc/get-started)
  guide, new [use cases](/doc/use-cases), DVC internals, and lot of other great
  stuff you can find here.

- üôÇ **Usability improvements** - DVC interface got more informative and easier
  to use:

  - More heavy operations render dynamic progress bar (e.g. hash computation):
    ![](/static/img/0.18-progress.gif)

  - Pipeline visualization via command line. Just run `dvc pipeline show` with
    `ascii` option and a target: ![](/static/img/0.18-pipeline.gif)

  - Many hidden gems: `dvc repro` dry and interactive modes, improved overall
    commands verbosity and revised commands help.

- üíé **Other changes include** -
  [DEB and RPM repositories](/doc/get-started/install), bug fixes and other
  things you can check in the complete
  [changelog](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/releases).
