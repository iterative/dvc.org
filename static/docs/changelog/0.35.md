# v0.19 - v0.35

We've launched the
[DVC Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/DVCorg/overview) - it's one of
the ways to support the project if you like it.

Now, let’s **highlight the changes** (not including bug fixes, and minor
improvements) we have done in the last few months:

- 🏷 We received a lot of feedback that using Git branches is not always an
  optimal way to manage experiments. We have added an option to **support Git
  tags** (Git commits are coming). The new option `-T` or `--all-tags` is
  supported by all DVC commands that support`-a` or `--all-branches`.

- 📖 [Get started guide](https://dvc.org/doc/get-started/agenda) has been
  simplified (e.g. to use tags instead of branches) and extended. We have also
  prepared a
  [Github DVC project ](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started)that
  reflects the sequence of steps in the “get started” guide. You can now
  download the whole project and reproduce all the models.

- **`dvc diff`** **command introduced**. Summary statistics for the
  directory/file under the DVC control. How many files were
  added/deleted/modified/size:

  ```diff
  (HEAD)$ tree image     (HEAD^)$ tree image
  images                 images
  ├── color.png          └── grey.png
  └── grey.png
  ```

  ```dvc
  $ dvc diff -t images HEAD^1

  diff for 'images'
  -images with md5 ad0a6adcd409cae3263b28487064e1f2.dir
  +images with md5 283215dface0d41291482330324632fc.dir

  1 file not changed, 0 files modified, 1 file added, 0 files deleted, size was increased by 15.3 MB
  ```

- We’ve introduced the dvc commit command and `dvc run/repro/add --no-commit`
  flag to give a way to **avoid uncontrolled cache growth** and as a way to save
  some `dvc repro` runs. In the future we plan to have “do-not-cache-my-data” as
  a default mode for `dvc run`, `dvc add` and `dvc repro`.
- **SSH remotes (data storage) support** - config options to set port, key
  files, timeouts, password, etc + improved stability and Windows support!
  Introduced **HTTP remotes** - external dependencies and as a read-only cache.
- **Control over where DVC files are located in your project** - place them
  wherever you want with the `-f` option supported by all relevant commands -
  `dvc add`, `dvc run`, and `dvc import`.
- 🙂A lot of **UI improvements** . Starting from the finally fixed nasty issue
  with Windows terminal printing a lot of garbage symbols, to using progress
  bars for checkouts, better metrics output, and lots of smaller things:

- **⚡️Performance optimizations.** The most notable one is the migration from
  using the plain JSON file to the embedded SQLLite engine to cache file and
  directory checksums, another one is improved performance, stability and
  general user experience for the commands that navigate tags or branches (all
  the commands that include `--all-bracnhes`, `-a` or `--all-tags`, `-T`).

There are new
[DVC integrations and plugins](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/plugins)
available:

- Finally there is an official
  [Bash and Zsh completion](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/autocomplete) for
  DVC!
- David Příhoda contributed and is developing the
  [JetBrains IDEs plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11368-data-version-control-dvc-support)
  (PyCharm, IntelliJ, etc).
