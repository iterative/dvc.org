# Use Cases

Here we provide an overview for some DVC use cases - from very basic
([data and model files management](/doc/use-cases/data-and-model-files-versioning))
to more advanced (optimizing resources on a
[single development machine](/doc/use-cases/multiple-data-scientists-on-a-single-machine)).
This list is _not_ exhaustive. We keep growing it and try to include interesting
scenarios from the community. Please, [contact us](/support) if you have some
suggestions!

If you want to get some hands-on experience we recommend to follow along
[Get Started](/doc/get-started) and try examples at the very end of it. They
include prepared data sets and code to run. Use cases are not written to be run
end to end, specifically we do not provide prepared data sets and code to train
models.
