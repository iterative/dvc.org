# Initialize

In order to start using DVC, you need first to initialize it in your project's
directory. DVC doesn't require Git and can work without any source control
management system, but for the best experience we recommend using DVC on top of
Git repositories.

If you don't have a directory for your project already, create it now with these
commands:

```dvc
$ mkdir example-get-started && cd example-get-started
$ git init
```

Run DVC initialization in a repository directory to create the DVC meta files
and directories:

```dvc
$ dvc init
$ git commit -m "initialize DVC"
```

After DVC initialization, a new directory `.dvc/` will be created with `config`
and `.gitignore` files and `cache` directory. These files and directories are
hidden from the user generally and are not meant to be manipulated directly.

> See `dvc init` if you want to get more details about the initialization
> process, and
> [DVC Files and Directories](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories) to
> learn about the DVC internal file and directories structure.

The last command, `git commit`, puts the `.dvc/config` and `.dvc/.gitignore`
files (DVC internals) under Git control.
