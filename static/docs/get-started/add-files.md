# Add Files or Directories

DVC allows storing and versioning source data files, ML models, directories,
intermediate results with Git, without checking the file contents into Git.
Let's get a sample data set to play with:

### Expand to learn how to download on Windows

Windows does not ship `wget` utility by default, so you'll need to use a browser
to download `data.xml` and save it into `data` subdirectory. To download,
right-click [this link](https://dvc.org/s3/get-started/data.xml) and click
`Save link as`(Chrome) or `Save object as`(Firefox).

</details>

```dvc
$ mkdir data
$ wget https://dvc.org/s3/get-started/data.xml -O data/data.xml
```

To take a file (or a directory) under DVC control just run `dvc add`, it accepts
any **file** or a **directory**:

```dvc
$ dvc add data/data.xml
```

DVC stores information about your data file in a special `.dvc` file, that has a
human-readable [description](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) and can be
committed to Git to track versions of your file:

```dvc
$ git add data/.gitignore data/data.xml.dvc
$ git commit -m "add source data to DVC"
```

<details>

### Expand to learn about DVC internals

You can see that actual data file has been moved to the `.dvc/cache` directory,
while the entries in the working directory may be links to the actual files in
the DVC cache. (See [Cache File Linking](/docs/user-guide/cache-file-linking) to
learn about the supported file linking options, their tradeoffs, and how to
enable them).

```dvc
$ ls -R .dvc/cache
    .dvc/cache/a3:
    04afb96060aad90176268345e10355
```

where `a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355` is an MD5 hash of the `data.xml` file.
And if you check the `data/data.xml.dvc` meta-file you will see that it has this
hash inside.

### Expand for an important note on cache performance

DVC tries to use reflinks\* by default to link your data files from the DVC
cache to the workspace, optimizing speed and storage space. However, reflinks
are not widely supported yet and DVC falls back to actually copying data files
to/from the cache **which can be very slow with large files**, and duplicates
storage requirements.

Hardlinks and symlinks are also available for optimized cache linking but,
(unlike reflinks) they carry the risk of accidentally corrupting the cache if
tacked data files are modified in the workspace.

See [Cache File Linking](/docs/user-guide/cache-file-linking) and
`dvc config cache` for more information.

> \***copy-on-write links or "reflinks"** are a relatively new way to link files
> in UNIX-style file systems. Unlike hardlinks or symlinks, they support
> transparent [copy on write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write). This
> means that editing a reflinked file is always safe as all the other links to
> the file will reflect the changes.

Refer to
[Data and Model Files Versioning](/doc/use-cases/data-and-model-files-versioning),
`dvc add`, and `dvc run` for more information on storing and versioning data
files with DVC.
