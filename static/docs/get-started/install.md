# Install

There are three ways to install DVC: `pip`, OS package, and Homebrew (depending
on your OS some of these ways may be not available for you).

The simplest way to install DVC is:

```dvc
    $ pip install dvc
```

If you have troubles installing it with `pip`, self-contained binary packages
are provided, use Download button to the left or get them

and `homebrew` repositories:
