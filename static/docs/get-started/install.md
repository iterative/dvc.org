# Install

There are three ways to install DVC: `pip`, OS-specific package, and Homebrew
(depending on your OS some of these ways may be not available for you).

To install DVC from terminal, run:

```dvc
$ pip install dvc
```

> Depending on the [remote storage](/doc/commands-reference/remote) type you
> plan to use to keep and share your data, you might need to specify one of the
> optional dependencies: `s3`, `gs`, `azure`, `ssh`. Or `all_remotes` to include
> them all. The command should look like this: `pip install 'dvc[s3]'` - it
> installs the `boto3` library along with DVC to support the AWS S3 storage.
> This is valid for `pip install` option only. Other ways to install DVC already
> include support for all remotes.

As an easier option, self-contained binary packages are also available. Use the
Download button in the [home page](https://dvc.org/) to the left or get them

and `homebrew` repositories:
