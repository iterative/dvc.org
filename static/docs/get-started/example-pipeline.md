# Example: Pipelines

To show DVC in action, let's play with an actual machine learning scenario.
Let's explore the natural language processing (NLP) problem of predicting tags
for a given StackOverflow question. For example, we want one classifier which
can predict a post that is about the Python language by tagging it `python`.
This is a short version of the [Tutorial](/doc/tutorial).

In this example, we will focus on building a simple pipeline that takes an
archive with StackOverflow posts and trains the prediction model and saves it as
an output. Check [get started](/doc/get-started) to see links to other examples,
tutorials, use cases if you want to cover other aspects of the DVC. The pipeline
itself is a sequence of transformation we apply to the data file:

![](/static/img/example-flow-2x.png)

DVC helps to describe these transformations and capture actual data involved -
input data set we are processing, intermediate artifacts (useful if some
transformations take a lot of time to run), output models. This way we can
capture what data and code were used to produce a specific model in a sharable
and reproducible way.

## Initialize

Okay, let's first download the code and set up a Git repository. This step has
nothing to do with DVC so far, it's just a simple preparation:

### Expand to learn how to download on Windows

Windows does not ship `wget` utility by default, so you'll need to use just use
your browser to download `code.zip`.

</details>

```dvc
$ mkdir example
$ cd example
$ git init
$ wget https://dvc.org/s3/examples/so/code.zip
$ unzip code.zip
$ rm -f code.zip
$ git add code/
$ git commit -m "download and initialize code"
```

(Optional) It's highly recommended to initialize a virtual environment to keep
your global packages clean and untouched:

```dvc
$ virtualenv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ echo ".env/" >> .gitignore
```

Install the required dependencies:

```dvc
$ pip install -r code/requirements.txt
```

Then, we are creating the pipeline step-by-step, utilizing the same set of
commands that are described in the [get started](/doc/get-started) chapters.

- Initialize DVC repository (run it inside your Git repository):

```dvc
$ dvc init
$ git commit -m "initialize DVC"
```

- Download an input data set to the `data` directory and take it under DVC
  control:

```dvc
$ mkdir data
$ wget -P data https://dvc.org/s3/examples/so/Posts.xml.zip
$ dvc add data/Posts.xml.zip
```

<details>

### Expand to learn more about DVC internals

`dvc init` created a new directory `example/.dvc/` with `config`, `.gitignore`
files and `cache` directory. These files and directories are hidden from a user
in general and a user does not interact with these files directly. Check
[DVC Files and Directories](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories) to learn
more.

When we run `dvc add Posts.xml.zip` the following happens. DVC creates an
_orphaned_ version of the [stage file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format):

```yaml
md5: 4dbe7a4e5a0d41b652f3d6286c4ae788
outs:
  - cache: true
    md5: ce68b98d82545628782c66192c96f2d2
    path: Posts.xml.zip
```

This is the file that should be committed into a version control system instead
of the data file itself.

Actual data file `Posts.xml.zip` is linked into the `.dvc/cache` directory,
under the `.dvc/cache/ce/68b98d82545628782c66192c96f2d2` name and is added to
`.gitignore`. Even if you remove it in the workspace, or checkout a different
branch/commit the data is not lost if a corresponding DVC file is committed.
It's enough to run `dvc checkout` or `dvc pull` to restore data files.

</details>

- Commit the data file meta-information to Git repository:

```dvc
$ git add data/Posts.xml.zip.dvc data/.gitignore
$ git commit -m "add dataset"
```

## Define steps

Each step is described by providing a command to run, input data it takes and a
list of output files. DVC is not Python or any other language specific and can
wrap any command runnable via CLI.

- The first actual step, extract XML from the archive. Note, we don't need to
  run `dvc add` on `Posts.xml`, `dvc run` saves (commits into the cache, takes
  the file under DVC control) automatically:

```dvc
$ dvc run -d data/Posts.xml.zip \
          -o data/Posts.xml \
          -f extract.dvc \
          unzip data/Posts.xml.zip -d data
```

<details>

### Expand to learn more about DVC internals

Similar to `dvc add`, `dvc run` creates a
[stage file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format):

```yaml
cmd: ' unzip data/Posts.xml.zip -d data'
deps:
  - md5: ce68b98d82545628782c66192c96f2d2
    path: data/Posts.xml.zip
md5: abaf651846ec4fb7a4a8e1a685546ed9
outs:
  - cache: true
    md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: data/Posts.xml
```

This file is using the same technique - pointers (md5 hashes) to the cache to
describe and version control dependencies and outputs. Output `Posts.xml` file
is automatically added to the `.gitignore` file and a link is created into a
cache `.dvc/cache/a3/04afb96060aad90176268345e10355` to save it.

Two things are worth noticing here. First, by analyzing dependencies and outputs
that DVC files describe, we can restore the full chain (DAG) of commands we need
to apply. This is important when you run `dvc repro` to reproduce the final or
intermediate result.

Second, you should see by now that the actual data is stored in the `.dvc/cache`
directory, each file having a name in a form of an md5 hash. This cache is
similar to Git's internal objects store but made specifically to handle large
data files. DVC is using reflinks, hardlinks and other optimizations to manage
your actual workspace without copying every time object from/to the cache.

- Next step, let's convert XML into TSV to make feature extraction easier:

```dvc
$ dvc run -d code/xml_to_tsv.py -d data/Posts.xml \
          -o data/Posts.tsv \
          -f prepare.dvc \
          python code/xml_to_tsv.py data/Posts.xml data/Posts.tsv
```

- Split training and test data sets. Here `0.2` is a test dataset split ratio,
  `20170426` is a seed for randomization. There are two output files:

```dvc
$ dvc run -d code/split_train_test.py -d data/Posts.tsv \
          -o data/Posts-train.tsv -o data/Posts-test.tsv \
          -f split.dvc \
          python code/split_train_test.py data/Posts.tsv 0.2 20170426 \
                                          data/Posts-train.tsv data/Posts-test.tsv
```

- Extract features and labels from the data. Two TSV as inputs with two pickle
  matrices as outputs:

```dvc
$ dvc run -d code/featurization.py -d data/Posts-train.tsv -d data/Posts-test.tsv \
          -o data/matrix-train.pkl -o data/matrix-test.pkl \
          -f featurize.dvc \
          python code/featurization.py data/Posts-train.tsv data/Posts-test.tsv \
                                           data/matrix-train.pkl data/matrix-test.pkl
```

- Train ML model on the training data set. 20170426 is a seed value here:

```dvc
$ dvc run -d code/train_model.py -d data/matrix-train.pkl \
          -o data/model.pkl \
          -f train.dvc \
          python code/train_model.py data/matrix-train.pkl 20170426 data/model.pkl
```

- Finally, evaluate the model on the test data set and get the metrics file:

```dvc
$ dvc run -d code/evaluate.py -d data/model.pkl -d data/matrix-test.pkl \
          -M auc.metric \
          -f evaluate.dvc \
          python code/evaluate.py data/model.pkl data/matrix-test.pkl auc.metric
```

By analyzing dependencies and outputs DVC files describe we can restore the full
chain (DAG) of commands we need to apply. This is important when you run
`dvc repro` to reproduce the final or intermediate result.

`dvc pipeline show` helps to visualize the pipeline (run it with `-c` option to
see actual commands instead of DVC-files):

```dvc
    $ dvc pipeline show --ascii evaluate.dvc

## Check results

> simpler to run this pipeline, exact metric number may vary sufficiently
> depending on Python version you are using and other environment parameters.

- An easy way to see metrics across different branches:

```dvc
$ dvc metrics show

  auc.metric: 0.620091
```

It's time to save the pipeline. You can check using `git status` command that we
do not save pickle model files or initial data sets into Git. We are just saving
a snapshot of the DVC files that describe data and code versions and
relationships between them.

```dvc
$ git add *.dvc auc.metric
$ git commit -am "create pipeline"
```

## Reproduce

All steps could be automatically and efficiently reproduced even if some source
files have been modified. For example:

- Let's improve the feature extraction algorithm by making some modification to
  the `code/featurization.py`:

```dvc
$ vi code/featurization.py
```

Specify `ngram` parameter in `CountVectorizer` (lines 72–73):

```python
    bag_of_words = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english',
                                   max_features=5000,
                                   ngram_range=(1, 2))
```

- Reproduce all required steps to get our target metrics file:

```dvc
$ dvc repro evaluate.dvc
```

> Since the data set for this example is extremely simplified to make it simpler
> to run this pipeline, exact metric numbers may vary significantly depending on
> the Python version you are using and other environment parameters.

- Take a look at the target metric improvement:

```dvc
$ dvc metrics show -a
master:
   auc.metric: 0.666618
```

## Conclusion

By wrapping your commands with `dvc run` it's easy to integrate DVC into your
existing ML development pipeline/processes without any significant effort to
re-implement your code/application.

The key step to note is that DVC automatically derives the dependencies between
the experiment steps and builds the dependency graph (DAG) transparently.

Not only can DVC streamline your work into a single, reproducible environment,
it also makes it easy to share this environment by Git including the
dependencies — an exciting collaboration feature which gives the ability to
reproduce the research easily in a myriad of environments.
