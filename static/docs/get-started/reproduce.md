# Reproduce

In the previous section, we described our first pipeline. Basically, we created
a number of `*.dvc` files. Each file describes a single step we need to run to
get to the final result. Each depends on some data (either source data files or
some intermediate results from another `*.dvc` file) and code files.

If you freshly checked out the project, make sure you first fetch the input data
from DVC by calling `dvc pull`.

It's now extremely easy for you or anyone in your team to reproduce the result
end-to-end:

```dvc
$ dvc repro train.dvc
```

`train.dvc` file internally describes what data files and code we should take
and how to run the command to get the binary model file. For each data file it
depends on, we can, in turn, do the same analysis - find a corresponding `.dvc`
file that includes the data file in its outputs, get dependencies and commands,
and so on. It means that DVC can recursively build a complete tree of commands
it needs to execute to get the model file.

`dvc repro` is, essentially, building this execution graph, detects stages with
modified dependencies or missing outputs and recursively executes this graph
starting from these stages.

Thus, `dvc run` and `dvc repro` provide a powerful framework for _reproducible
experiments_ and _reproducible projects_.
