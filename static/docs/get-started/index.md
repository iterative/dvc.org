# Get Started

Get started is a step by step introduction into basic DVC concepts. It doesn't
go into details much, but provides links and expandable sections to learn more.

At the very end there are a few complete step-by-step examples to give you more
hands-on experience with real life scenarios. The first on is about model and
dataset [versioning](/doc/get-started/example-versioning), and the second one is
focused on [pipelines and reproducibility](/doc/get-started/example-pipeline).
