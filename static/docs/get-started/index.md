# Get Started

_Get Started_ is a step-by-step introduction into basic DVC concepts. It doesn't
go into details much, but provides links and expandable sections to learn more.

experience with real life scenarios. The first one is about model and dataset
[versioning](/doc/tutorials/versioning), and the second one is focused on
[pipelines and reproducibility](/doc/tutorials/pipelines).
