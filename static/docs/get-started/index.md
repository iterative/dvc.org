# Get Started

Get started is a step by step introduction into basic DVC concepts. It does not
go into details much, but provides links and expandable sections to learn more.

At the very end there are a few complete step-by-step examples to give you more
hands-on experience with real-life scenarios - first is about model and data set
[versioning](/doc/get-started/example-versioning), and the second one is focused
on [pipelines](/doc/get-started/example-pipeline) and reproducibility.
