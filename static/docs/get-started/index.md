# Get Started

_Get Started_ is a step-by-step introduction into basic DVC concepts. It doesn't
go into details much, but provides links and expandable sections to learn more.

At the very end there are a few complete examples to give you more hands-on
experience with real life scenarios. The first one is about model and dataset
[versioning](/doc/tutorials/versioning), and the second one is focused on
[pipelines and reproducibility](/doc/tutorials/pipelines).
