# Sharing Data

## Pushing data to the cloud

It is pretty clear how code and DVC-files can be shared through Git
repositories. These repositories will contain all the information needed for
reproducibility and it might be a good idea to share these DVC-repositories
using GitHub or other Git services.

DVC is able to push the cache to a cloud.

> Using your shared cache a colleague can reuse ML models that were trained on

First, you need to modify the cloud settings in the DVC config file. This can be
done using the CLI:

> Please note that we are using `dvc-share` s3 bucket as an example and you
> don't have a write access to it, so in order to follow the tutorial you will
> need to either create your own s3 bucket or use other types of
> [remote storage](/doc/commands-reference/remote). E.g. you can set up a local
> remote as we did in the [Get Started configure](/doc/get-started/configure)
> section.

```dvc
$ dvc remote add -d upstream s3://dvc-share/classify
$ git status -s
 M .dvc/config
```

Then, a simple command pushes files from your local cache to the cloud:

```dvc
$ dvc push
(1/9): [#########################] 100% 23/404ed8212fc1ee6f5a81ff6f6df2ef
(2/9): [##########               ] 34% 5f/42ecd9a121b4382cd6510534533ec3
```

The command does not push all cached files, but only the ones that belong to the
currently active Git repository and branch.

For example, in this tutorial 16 data files were created and only 9 will be
pushed because the rest of the data files belong to different branches like
`bigram`.

## Pulling data from the cloud

In order to reuse your data files, a colleague of yours can pull data the same
way from the master branch:

```dvc
$ git clone https://github.com/dmpetrov/new_tag_classifier.git
$ dvc pull
```

After executing this command, all the data files will be in the right place. You
can check that by trying to reproduce the default goal:

```dvc
# Nothing to reproduce:
$ dvc repro
```
