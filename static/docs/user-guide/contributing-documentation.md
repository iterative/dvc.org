# Contributing to the Documentation

We welcome any contributions to our documentation repository,
[dvc.org](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org). Contribution can be an update
to the documentation or (rare) updating or fixing the JS engine that we use to
run the website.

## Structure of the project

To contribute documentation you need to know these locations:

- [Content](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/tree/master/static/docs)
  (`/static/docs`) -
  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files of
  the different pages to render dynamically in the browser.

- [Images](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/tree/master/static/img)
  (`/static/img`) - add new images, gif, svg, etc here. Reference them from the
  Markdown files like this: `![](/static/img/reproducibility.png)`.

- [Sections](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/tree/master/src/Documentation/sidebar.json)
  (`.../sidebar.json`) - edit it to register a new section for the navigation
  menu.

Merging the appropriate changes to these files into the master branch is enough
to update the docs and redeploy the website.

## Submitting changes

In case of a minor change, you can use the **Edit on Github** button (found to
the right of each page) to fork the project, edit it in place (check the right
top corner for an Edit button on Github), and create a pull request (PR).

Otherwise, please refer to the following procedure:

- Find or open a new issue in the
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues) to let us know
  that you are working on this.
- Format the code by following the
  [code style guidelines](#code-style-guidelines) below. It's highly recommended
  setup the [development environment](#development-environment) explained above.
  It can help you to format your the documentation and/or JS engine files
  automatically. Otherwise, we recommend using the Visual Studio Code and the
  [Rewrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap)
  plugin to format the content of Markdown files.
- Push the changes to your fork of
  [dvc.org](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org.git) and create a PR to the
  original repository.

We will review your PR as soon as possible. Thank you for contributing!

## Development environment

Installing development environment is _highly_ recommended to format your code
and documents in accordance with the style guide automatically, and to run the
server locally in case you are making some JS engine changes.

- Get the latest development version by
  [forking](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) and cloning the
  repository from GitHub:

  ```dvc
  $ git clone git@github.com:<username>/dvc.org.git
  ```

Next step, along with installing dependencies that are necessary to run the
website locally, will enable the pre-commit hook that will be formatting your
code and documentation files automatically:

- Make sure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  installed. Install and keep the dependencies up to date by running
  `npm install` often.

It's highly recommended to run the Node.js docs app locally to test significant
changes to the docs before submitting them, and its very much needed in order to
make changes to the docs JavaScript engine itself (rare). These changes need to
be properly formatted as well. This is also ensured in the following steps for
setting up.

- Start the development server using `npm run dev` which will start the server
  on the default port `3000`.

- Visit `http://localhost:3000/` and navigate to the docs in question.

## Code style guidelines

- No trailing whitespaces are allowed.

- Content must be properly formatted at 80 symbols width. We recommend using
  Visual Studio Code and the
  [Rewrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap)
  plugin. Correct formatting will be done automatically by a Git pre-commit hook
  which is integrated when `npm install` runs in the instructions above.

- We use `prettier` default conventions to format our files. The formatting of
  staged files will automatically be done by the Git pre-commit hook we have
  configured. You may also run `npx prettier --write <file path(s)>` manually
  before committing changes.

- **Markdown**: Using `dvc <command>` in the documentation will create a link to
  that command automatically. No need to use `[]()` explicitly to create them.

- **Markdown**: Syntax highlighting in fenced code blocks should use the `usage`
  and `dvc` custom languages. `usage` is employed to show `dvc help` commands
  output in each command reference doc. `dvc` can be used to show
  [DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) contents, or examples of console
  commands and their output.

> Check out any of the command reference `.md` source code to get a better idea.
