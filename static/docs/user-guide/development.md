# Development Version

If you would like to install the latest version of DVC, you can do the
following:

**Note**: `gitpython` should be installed first to allow `setup.py` to
dynamically generate dvc version from the current git commit sha. It allows us
to distinguish official dvc release (e.g. `0.24.3`) from a development version
(e.g. `0.24.3-9c7381`).

```dvc
    $ pip install gitpython
    $ pip install git+git://github.com/iterative/dvc
```

**Note**: this will automatically upgrade your DVC version to the latest
development version.
