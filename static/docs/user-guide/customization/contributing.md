We welcome contributions to [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) by the
community.

## How to report a problem

Please search [issue tracker](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues) before
creating a new issue (problem or an improvement request). Feel free to add
issues related to the project and [dvc.org](https://dvc.org) site.

If you feel that you can fix or implement it, please read a few paragraphs below
to learn how to submit your changes.

## Submitting changes

* Open a new issue in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues).
* Setup the [development environment](#development-environment) if you need to
run tests or [run](#running-development-version) the
DVC with your changes.
* Fork [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.git) and prepare necessary
changes.
* Add tests for your changes to `tests/test_*.py`.
* [Run tests](#running-tests) and make sure all of them pass.
* Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

We will review your pull request as soon as possible. Thank you for
contributing!

## Development environment

* Get the latest development version. Fork and clone the repo:
  ```dvc
      $ git clone git@github.com:<username>/dvc.git
  ```
* Make sure that you have python 3 installed. Version 3.6 or higher is required
to run style checkers on pre-commit. On Mac OS, use `brew` to install the
latest version of python.
* Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and
`pip install -r tests/requirements.txt`. We **strongly** recommend initializing a
[virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/) before
installing the required libraries. For example: 
  ```dvc
      $ cd dvc
      $ virtualenv --python python3 .env
      $ source .env/bin/activate
      $ pip install -r requirements.txt
      $ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
      $ pip install -e .
  ```
* Install coding style pre-commit hooks with
  ```dvc
      $ pip install pre-commit
      $ pre-commit install
  ```

That should be it. You should be ready to make changes, run tests do commits! If
you experience any problems, please don't hesitate to ping us in our
[chat](/chat).

## Running tests

The simplest way to run tests:

```dvc
    $ cd dvc
    $ python -m tests
```

Internally, it is using `pytest` to run the full test suite and report the
result. At the very end you should see something like this:

```dvc
    $ python -m tests

    ...

    ============= 434 passed, 6 skipped, 8 warnings in 131.43 seconds ==============
```

Otherwise, for each failed test you should see and output like this that should
help you identify the problem:

```
    $ python -m tests

    ...

    [gw2] [ 84%] FAILED tests/unit/test_progress.py::TestProgressAware::test 
    tests/unit/test_prompt.py::TestConfirm::test_eof 
    tests/test_updater.py::TestUpdater::test 
    ...
    =================================== FAILURES ===================================
    ____________________________ TestProgressAware.test ____________________________
    ...
    ======== 1 failed, 433 passed, 6 skipped, 8 warnings in 137.49 seconds =========
```

You can pass any additional arguments to the script that will override the
default `pytest`'s scope:

To run a single test case:

```dvc
    $ python -m tests tests/test_metrics.py:TestCachedMetrics
```

To pass additional arguments:

```dvc
    $ python -m tests --pdb
```

## Running development version

To run DVC from its Git repository you need to setup your environment:

* Export `DVC_HOME` variable that is pointing to the root of your repository:
    ```dvc
      $ export DVC_HOME=/home/user/git/dvc
    ```

* Modify and export `PATH` variable to include location of our wrapper script:
    ```dvc
      $ export PATH=$PATH:$DVC_HOME/bin
    ```

* Check that `dvc` points to your repository:
    ```dvc
      $ which dvc
      /home/user/git/dvc/bin/dvc
    ```
