We welcome contributions to [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) by the
community.

## How to report a problem

Please search [issue tracker](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues) before
creating a new issue (problem or an improvement request). Feel free to add
issues related to the project and [dvc.org](https://dvc.org) site.

If you feel that you can fix or implement it, please read a few paragraphs below
to learn how to submit your changes.

## Submitting changes

- Open a new issue in the
  [issue tracker](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues).
- Setup the [development environment](#development-environment) if you need to
  run tests or [run](#running-development-version) the DVC with your changes.
- Fork [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.git) and prepare necessary
  changes.
- Add tests for your changes to `tests/test_*.py`.
- [Run tests](#running-tests) and make sure all of them pass.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

We will review your pull request as soon as possible. Thank you for
contributing!

## Development environment

- Get the latest development version. Fork and clone the repo:
  ```dvc
  $ git clone git@github.com:<username>/dvc.git
  ```
- Make sure that you have python 3 installed. Version 3.6 or higher is required
  to run style checkers on pre-commit. On Mac OS, use `brew` to install the
  latest version of python.
- Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and
  `pip install -r tests/requirements.txt`. We **strongly** recommend
  initializing a
  [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/) before
  installing the required libraries. For example:
  ```dvc
  $ cd dvc
  $ virtualenv --python python3 .env
  $ source .env/bin/activate
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  $ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
  $ pip install -e .
  ```
- Install coding style pre-commit hooks with
  ```dvc
  $ pip install pre-commit
  $ pre-commit install
  ```

That should be it. You should be ready to make changes, run tests do commits! If
you experience any problems, please don't hesitate to ping us in our
[chat](/chat).

## Running tests

The simplest way to run tests:

```dvc
$ cd dvc
$ python -m tests
```

Internally, it is using `pytest` to run the full test suite and report the
result. At the very end you should see something like this:

```dvc
$ python -m tests

...

============= 434 passed, 6 skipped, 8 warnings in 131.43 seconds ==============
```

Otherwise, for each failed test you should see and output like this that should
help you identify the problem:

```
$ python -m tests

...

[gw2] [ 84%] FAILED tests/unit/test_progress.py::TestProgressAware::test
tests/unit/test_prompt.py::TestConfirm::test_eof
tests/test_updater.py::TestUpdater::test
...
=================================== FAILURES ===================================
____________________________ TestProgressAware.test ____________________________
...
======== 1 failed, 433 passed, 6 skipped, 8 warnings in 137.49 seconds =========
```

You can pass any additional arguments to the script that will override the
default `pytest`'s scope:

To run a single test case:

```dvc
$ python -m tests tests/func/test_metrics.py::TestCachedMetrics
```

To pass additional arguments:

```dvc
$ python -m tests --pdb
```

## Testing remotes

This tests require additional effort to set up, so they are skipped by default.
You don't need this in most cases, however, if you develop or fix some remote
related code you might need to go through steps below.

Install requirements for whatever remote(s) you are going to test:

```dvc
$ pip install -e .[s3]
$ pip install -e .[gs]
$ pip install -e .[azure]
$ pip install -e .[ssh]
# or
$ pip install -e .[all]
```

You will need to update your `ENV` throughout subsequent steps, so we created a
template for you:

```dvc
$ cp tests/remotes_env.sample tests/remotes_env
```

Then uncomment lines you need and fill in needed values, the details are
explained in remote specific subsections. To activate these env vars use:

```dvc
$ source tests/remotes_env
```

If some member of your team had already went through all of this you may just
ask his `remotes_env` file and Google Cloud credentials and you can skip any
manipulations with `ENV` below.

### Click for S3 testing instructions

Install
[aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
tools.

Set up an account, get credentials, which will have access to S3. When set `ENV`
vars like this:

```dvc
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="...YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID..."
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="...YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY..."
$ export DVC_TEST_AWS_REPO_BUCKET="...TEST-S3-BUCKET..."
```

### Click for Google Cloud storage testing instructions

Go through [quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) for your
OS. After that you should have `gcloud` command line tool available and
authenticated with your google account.

You then need to create a bucket, a service account and get its credentials. You
can do this via web UI or console. Then you need to put your keys to
`scripts/ci/gcp-creds.json` and add these to your `ENV`:

```dvc
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=".gcp-creds.json"
$ export GCP_CREDS="yes"
$ export DVC_TEST_GCP_REPO_BUCKET="dvc-test-xyz"
```

Here goes a sample code to do this:

```dvc
# This name needs to be globally unique
$ export GCP_NAME="dvc-test-xyz"
$ gcloud projects create $GCP_NAME
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create $GCP_NAME --project=$GCP_NAME
$ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create \
    scripts/ci/gcp-creds.json \
    --iam-account=$GCP_NAME@$GCP_NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com

$ gcloud auth activate-service-account \
    --key-file=scripts/ci/gcp-creds.json
$ gcloud config set project $GCP_NAME
$ gsutil mb gs://$GCP_NAME/
```

I used the same name for project, service account and bucket for simplicity. You
may use different names.

### Click for Azure testing instructions

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and then install and run
Azurite:

```dvc
$ npm install -g 'azurite@<3' # Need 2.x version
$ mkdir azurite
$ azurite -s -l azurite -d azurite/debug.log
```

Add this to your `ENV`:

```dvc
$ export AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME="dvc-test"
$ export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;"
```

### Click for HDFS testing instructions

Tests currently only work on Linux. First you need to set up passwordless ssh
access to localhost:

```dvc
# Only run next line if you don't yet have keys
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Then run an install script:

```dvc
$ ./scripts/ci/install_hadoop.sh
```

To remove hadoop later use:

```dvc
$ ./scripts/ci/remove_hadoop.sh
```

</details>

## Running development version

To run DVC from its Git repository you need to setup your environment:

- Export `DVC_HOME` variable that is pointing to the root of your repository:

  ```dvc
  $ export DVC_HOME=/home/user/git/dvc
  ```

- Modify and export `PATH` variable to include location of our wrapper script:

  ```dvc
  $ export PATH=$PATH:$DVC_HOME/bin
  ```

- Check that `dvc` points to your repository:
  ```dvc
  $ which dvc
  /home/user/git/dvc/bin/dvc
  ```
