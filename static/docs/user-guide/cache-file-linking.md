# Performance Optimization for Large Files

In order to track the data files added with `dvc add` or `dvc run`, DVC moves
all these files to a special cache directory. The DVC cache is a hidden storage
(by default located in `.dvc/cache`) for files that are under DVC control, and
their different versions. (See `dvc cache` and
[DVC internal files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories) for more
details.)

However, the versions of the tracked files
[corresponding to the current code](/doc/get-started/connect-code-and-data)
branch are also needed in the workspace, so a subset of the cache files must be
kept in the working directory at all times (see `dvc checkout`). Does this mean
that some files will be duplicated between the workspace and the cache?
**That would not be efficient!** Especially with large files (several Gigabytes
or larger).

In order to have the files present in both directories without duplication, DVC
can automatically create **file links** in the workspace that "point" to the
data in cache.

## File link types for the DVC cache

File links are entries in the file system that don't necessarily hold the file
contents, but which point to where the file is actually stored. File links are
more common in file systems used with UNIX-like operating systems and come in
different kinds, that differ in how they connect filenames to inodes in the
system.

There are pros and cons to the 3 supported link types: Hard links, Soft or
Symbolic links, and Reflinks\* in more recent systems. While reflinks bring all
the benefits and none of the worries, they're not commonly supported in most
platforms yet. Hard/soft links also optimize speed and space in the file system,
but carry the risk of breaking your workflow, since updating tracked files in
the workspace causes data corruption. These 2 link types thus require using
cache protected mode (see the `cache.protected` config option in
`dvc config cache`). Finally, a 4th "linking" option is to actually `copy` files
from/to the cache, which is safe but quite inefficient for large files (not
recommended for GBs of data).

Each file linking option is further detailed below, in order of efficiency:

1. **`reflink`** - copy-on-write\* links or "reflinks" are the best possible
   link type, when available. They're is as fast as hard/symlinks, but don't
   carry a risk of cache corruption since the file system takes care of copying
   the file if you try to edit it in place, thus keeping a linked cache file
   intact.  
   Unfortunately reflinks are currently supported on a limited number of file
   systems only (Linux: Btrfs, XFS, OCFS2; MacOS: APFS), but in the future they
   will be supported by the majority of file systems in use.

2. **`hardlink`** - hard links are the most efficient way to link your data to
   cache if both your repo and your cache directory are located on the same file
   system/drive.  
   > Please note that hardlinked data files should never be edited in place, but
   > instead deleted and then replaced with a new file, otherwise it might cause
   > cache corruption and automatic deletion of cached files by DVC.

3. **`symlink`** - symbolic (aka "soft") links are the most efficient way to
   link your data to cache if your repo and your cache directory are located on
   different file systems/drives (i.e. repo is located on SSD for performance,
   but cache dir is located on HDD for bigger storage).  
   > Please note that symlinked data files should never be edited in place, but
   > instead deleted and then replaced with a new file, otherwise it might cause
   > cache corruption and automatic deletion of cached files by DVC.

4. **`copy`** - the most inefficient "linking" strategy, yet the most widely
   supported for any repo/cache file system combination. Using `copy` means
   there will be no links but the actual files will be duplicated by making
   copies from the cache into the workspace. Suitable for scenarios with
   relatively small data files, where copying them is not a storage performance
   concern

> accidental cache and repository corruption. Refer to the

### Configuring DVC cache file link type

By default DVC tries to use reflinks if available on your system, however this
is not the most common case at this time, so it falls back to the copying
strategy. If you wish to enable hard or soft links you can configure DVC like
this:

```dvc
$ dvc config cache.type reflink,hardlink,symlink
$ dvc config cache.protected true
```

> Refer to `dvc config cache` for more options.

Setting `cache.protected` is important with `hardlink` and/or `symlink` cache
file link types. Please refer to the
[Update a Tracked File](/docs/user-guide/update-tracked-file) on how to manage
tracked files under these cache configurations.
