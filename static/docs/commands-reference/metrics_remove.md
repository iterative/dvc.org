# remove

Keep file as an output, remove metric flag and stop tracking as a metric file.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc metrics remove [-h] [-q | -v] path

positional arguments:
  path           Path to a metric file.

```

## Description

This command searches for the corresponding DVC-file for the metric file `path`
provided (i.e. a DVC-file that specifies one of its outputs is the file path in
question – see `dvc metrics add` or `dvc run` with `-m` and `-M` options) and
resets the metric flag for the provided output.

It does not remove or delete the file provided. It only changes a flag in the
corresponding [DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format). It also keeps the
file as an output of the [stage](/doc/commands-reference/run) in question.

## Examples

Let's first create an output that is not a metric file:

```dvc
    $ dvc run -M metrics.tsv \
              "echo -e 'time/tauc/n2019-02-13/t0.9643' > metrics.tsv"
```

This command produces the following metrics file:

```dvc
$ cat metrics.tsv

time	auc
2019-02-13	0.9643

```

To extract the AUC value out of it, we can use the `-t` and `-x` options that
`dvc metrics show` command supports (alternatively, see `dvc metrics modify`
command to learn how to apply `-t` and `-x` permanently):

```dvc
$ dvc metrics show -t htsv -x 0,auc metrics.tsv

metrics.tsv: ['0.9643']
```

If you check the `metrics.tsv.dvc` file, you should see that `metric: true` is
set:

```yaml
cmd: echo -e 'time/tauc/n2019-02-13/t0.9643' > metrics.tsv
md5: 6f910c9000bb03492d1e66035ba8faf6
outs:
  - cache: false
    md5: 7ce0bc12da7f88c1493763cdd4c3f684
    metric: true
    path: metrics.tsv
```

Now, let's reset the flag with the `dvc metrics remove` command:

```dvc
$ dvc metrics remove metrics.tsv

Saving information to 'metrics.tsv.dvc'.
```

Let's check the same DVC-file now:

```yaml
cmd: echo -e 'time/tauc/n2019-02-13/t0.9643' > metrics.tsv
md5: 6f910c9000bb03492d1e66035ba8faf6
outs:
  - cache: false
    md5: 7ce0bc12da7f88c1493763cdd4c3f684
    metric: null
    path: metrics.tsv
```

As you can see, nothing has changed at all, except the flag `metric: true`. And
both files are still here:

```dvc
$ tree .

.
├── metrics.tsv
└── metrics.tsv.dvc

0 directories, 2 files
```
