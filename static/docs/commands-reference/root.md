# root

Returns relative path to project's directory.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc root [-h] [-q | -v]
```

## Description

While in project's sub-directory, sometimes developers may want to refer some
file belonging to another directory. This command returns relative path to the
DVC project's root directory from the current working directory. So, this
command can be used to build a path to a dependency file, command, or output.

## Options

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

1. Basic output:

```dvc
$ dvc root

.

$ cd subdir
$ dvc root

..
```

2. Referencing files:

```dvc
$ dvc root

../../../

$ dvc run -d $(dvc root)/data/file.cvs ... \
    python $(dvc root)/scripts/something.py
```
