# repro

Rerun commands recorded in the pipeline stages in the same order. Commands to
rerun are determined by recursively analyzing which stages and changes in their
dependencies to find only those that have to be rerun.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc repro [-h] [-q | -v]
                 [-f] [-s] [-c CWD] [-m] [--dry] [-i]
                 [-p] [-P] [--ignore-build-cache] [--no-commit]
                 [targets [targets ...]]

positional arguments:
    target                DVC file to reproduce.
```

## Description

DVC file (`target`) can have any name followed by the `.dvc` file extension. If
file name is omitted, `Dvcfile` will be used by default.

`dvc repro` provides an interface to rerun the commands in the computational
graph (a.k.a. pipeline) defined by the stage files in the current workspace. By
default, this command recursively searches, starting from the `Dvcfile`, the
pipeline stages to find any which have changed. It then reruns the corresponding
commands. The pipeline is mostly defined using the `dvc run` command, while data
input nodes are defined by the `dvc add` command.

There are several ways to restrict the stages to rerun, by listing stage file(s)
as targets, or using the `--single-item`, `--pipeline`, or `--cwd` options.

`dvc repro` does not run `dvc fetch`, `dvc pull` or `dvc checkout` to get source
data files, intermediate or final results. It saves (unless `--no-commit` option
is specified) all the data files, intermediate or final results into the DVC
local cache and updates stage files with the new checksum information.

## Options

- `-f`, `--force` - rerun the pipeline, reproducing its results, even if no
  changes were found. By default this reruns the entire pipeline. To rerun a
  single stage, specify the stage name on the command-line along with the
  `--single-item` option.

- `-s`, `--single-item` - reproduce only a single stage by turning off the
  recursive search for changed dependencies. Multiple stages are rerun if
  multiple stage names are listed on the command-line.

- `-c`, `--cwd` - directory within your project to reproduce from. If no target
  names are given, it attempts to use `Dvcfile` in the specified directory, if
  it exists, for stages to rerun. Instead of using `--cwd` one can alternately
  specify a target in a subdirectory as `path/to/target.dvc`. This could be
  useful for subdirectories containing a semi-independent pipeline, that can
  either be rerun as part of the pipeline in the parent directory, or as an
  independent unit.

- `--no-commit` - does not save outputs to cache. Useful when running different
  experiments and you don't want to fill up your cache with temporary files. Use
  `dvc commit` when you are ready to save your results to cache.

- `-m`, `--metrics` - show metrics after reproduction. The pipeline must have at
  least one metrics file defined either with the `dvc metrics` command, or by
  the `-M` or `-m` options on the `dvc run` command.

- `--dry` - only print the commands that would be executed without actually
  executing the commands.

- `-i`, `--interactive` - ask for confirmation before reproducing each stage.
  The stage is rerun if the user types "y".

- `-p`, `--pipeline` - reproduce the whole pipeline that the specified stage
  file belongs to. Use `dvc pipeline show target.dvc` to show the entire
  pipeline the named stage belongs to.

- `--ignore-build-cache` - in case like `... -> A (changed) -> B -> C` it will
  reproduce `A` first and then `B` even if `B` was previously executed with the
  same inputs from `A` (cached). It might be useful when we have a common
  dependency among all stages and want to specify it once (for the stage `A`
  here). For example, if we know that all stages - `A` and below - depend on
  `requirements.txt`, we can specify it only once in `A` and omit in `B` and
  `C`. To be precise - it reproduces all descendants of a changed stage, or the
  stages following the changed stage, even if their direct dependencies did not
  change. Like with the same option on `dvc run`, this is a way to force certain
  stages to run if they would not otherwise be rerun (thus the name). This can
  be useful also for pipelines containing stages that produce nondeterministic
  (semi-random) outputs. For nondeterministic stages the outputs can vary on
  each execution, meaning the cache cannot be trusted for such stages.

* `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - does not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if
  all stages are up to date or if all stages are successfully rerun, otherwise
  exit with 1. The command run by the stage is free to make output irregardless
  of this flag.

* `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

- `--downstream` - rerun the commands present in the downstream of the
  pipeline.

## Examples

For simplicity, let's build a pipeline defined below (if you want get your hands
on something more real, check this
[mini-tutorial](/doc/get-started/example-pipeline)). It takes this `text.txt`
file:

```
dvc
1231
is
3
the
best
```

And runs a few simple transformations to filter and count numbers:

```dvc
$ dvc run -f filter.dvc -d text.txt -o numbers.txt \
           "cat text.txt | egrep '[0-9]+' > numbers.txt"

$ dvc run -f Dvcfile -d numbers.txt -d process.py -M count.txt \
           "python process.py numbers.txt > count.txt"
```

Where `process.py` is a script which for simplicity just prints the number of
lines:

```python
import sys
num_lines = 0
with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        num_lines += 1
print(num_lines)
```

The result of executing these `dvc run` commands should look like this:

```dvc
$ tree
.
├── Dvcfile        <---- second stage with a default DVC name
├── count.txt      <---- result: "2"
├── filter.dvc     <---- first stage
├── numbers.txt    <---- intermediate result of the first stage
├── process.py     <---- code that runs some transformation
└── text.txt       <---- text file to process
```

Ok, now, let's run the `dvc repro` command (remember, by default it reproduces
outputs defined in `Dvcfile`, `count.txt` in this case):

```dvc
$ dvc repro

Stage 'filter.dvc' didn't change.
Stage 'Dvcfile' didn't change.
Pipeline is up to date. Nothing to reproduce.
```

It makes sense, since we haven't changed neither of the dependencies this
pipeline has: `text.txt` or `process.py`. Now, let's imagine we want to print a
description and we add this line to the `process.py`:

```python
...
print('Number of lines:')
print(num_lines)
```

If we now run `dvc repro`, that's what we should see:

```dvc
$ dvc repro

Stage 'filter.dvc' didn't change.
Stage 'Dvcfile' changed.
Reproducing 'Dvcfile'
Running command:
  python process.py numbers.txt > count.txt

Saving information to 'Dvcfile'.
```

You can check now that `Dvcfile` and `count.txt` have been updated with the new
information, new `md5` checksums and a new result respectively.
