# checkout

Update data files and directories in workspace based on current DVC-files.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc checkout [-h] [-q | -v]
                    [-d] [-f]
                    [targets [targets ...]]

positional arguments:
    targets          DVC-files.
```

## Description

[DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) in the workspace specify which
instance of each data file or directory is to be used, using the checksum saved
in the `outs` fields. The `dvc checkout` command updates the workspace data to
match with the cache files corresponding to those checksums.

Using an SCM like Git, the DVC-files are kept under version control. At a given
branch or tag of the SCM workspace, the DVC-files will contain checksums for the
corresponding data files kept in the DVC cache. After an SCM command like
`git checkout` is run, the DVC-files will change to the state at the specified
branch or commit or tag. Afterwards, the `dvc checkout` command is required in
order to synchronize the data files with the currently checked out DVC-files.

This command must be executed after `git checkout` since Git does not handle
files that are under DVC control. For convenience a Git hook is available,
simply by running `dvc install`, that will automate running `dvc checkout` after
`git checkout`. See `dvc install` for more information.

The execution of `dvc checkout` does:

- Scan the `outs` entries in DVC-files to compare with the currently checked out
  data files. The scanned DVC-files is limited by the listed `targets` (if any)
  on the command line. And if the `--with-deps` option is specified, it scans
  backward in the [pipeline](https://dvc.org/doc/get-started/pipeline) from the
  named targets.
- For any data files where the checksum does not match with the DVC-file entry,
  the data file is restored from the cache. The link strategy used (`reflink`,
  `hardlink`, `symlink`, or `copy`) depends on the OS and the configured value
  for `cache.type` – See `dvc config cache`.

Note that this DVC by default tries NOT to copy files between the cache and the
workspace by using reflinks when supported by the file system. (Refer to
[File link types](/docs/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization#file-link-types-for-the-dvc-cache).)
The next linking strategy default value is `copy` though, so unless other file
link types are manually configured in `cache.type` (using `dvc config`), files
will be copied. Keep in mind that having file copies doesn't present much of a
negative impact unless the project uses very large data (several GBs or more).
But leveraging file links is crucial for large files where checking out a 50Gb
by copying file might take a few minutes for example, whereas with links,
restoring any file size will be almost instantaneous.

> When linking files takes longer than expected (10 seconds for any one file)
> and `cache.type` is not set, a warning will be displayed reminding users about
> the faster link types available. These warnings can be turned off setting the
> `cache.slow_link_warning` config option to `false` with `dvc config cache`.

The output of `dvc checkout` does not list which data files were restored. It
does report removed files and files that DVC was unable to restore due to it
missing from the cache.

This command will fail to checkout files that are missing from the cache. In
such a case, `dvc checkout` prints a warning message. Any files that can be
checked out without error will be restored.

There are two methods to restore a file missing from the cache, depending on the
situation. In some cases the pipeline must be rerun using the `dvc repro`
command. In other cases the cache can be pulled from a remote cache using the
`dvc pull` command. See also `dvc pipeline`

## Options

- `-d`, `--with-deps` - determine workspace files to update by tracking
  dependencies to the named target DVC-file(s). This option only has effect when
  one or more `targets` are specified. By traversing all stage dependencies, DVC
  searches backward through the pipeline from the named target(s). This means
  DVC will not checkout files referenced later in the pipeline than the named
  target(s).

- `-f`, `--force` - does not prompt when removing workspace files. Changing the
  current set of DVC-files with SCM commands like `git checkout` can result in
  the need for DVC to remove files which should not exist in the current state
  and are missing in the local cache (they are not committed in DVC terms). This
  option controls whether the user will be asked to confirm these files removal.

- `-R`, `--recursive` - performs recursive checkout for target directory.

- `-h`, `--help` - shows the help message and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - does not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if
  no problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information from executing the
  `dvc pull` command.

## Examples

To explore `dvc checkout` let's consider a simple workspace with several
[stages](/doc/commands-reference/run), and a few Git tags. Then with
`git checkout` and `dvc checkout` we can see what happens as we shift from tag
to tag.

### Click and expand to setup the project

This step is optional, and you can run it only if you want to run this examples
in your environment. First, you need to download the project:

```dvc
$ git clone https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started
```

Second, let's install the requirements. But before we do that, we **strongly**
recommend creating a virtual environment with `virtualenv` or a similar tool:

```dvc
$ cd example-get-started
$ virtualenv -p python3 .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

Now, we can install requirements for the project:

```dvc
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</details>

The existing pipeline looks almost like in this
[example](/doc/get-started/example-pipeline):

```dvc
.
├── data
│   └── data.xml.dvc
├── evaluate.dvc
├── featurize.dvc
├── prepare.dvc
├── train.dvc
└── src
    └── <code files here>
```

We have these tags in the repository that represent different iterations of
solving the problem:

```dvc
$ git tag

baseline     <- first simple version of the model
bigram       <- use bigrams to improve the model
```

This project comes with a predefined HTTP
[remote storage](https://man.dvc.org/remote). We can now just run `dvc pull`
that will fetch and checkout the most recent `model.pkl`, `data.xml`, and other
files that are under DVC control. The model file checksum
`3863d0e317dee0a55c4e59d2ec0eef33` is specified in the `train.dvc` file:

```dvc
$ dvc pull
...
(1/6): [#######################] 100% model.pkl
Checking out model.pkl with cache '3863d0e317dee0a55c4e59d2ec0eef33'
...

$ md5 model.pkl
MD5 (model.pkl) = 3863d0e317dee0a55c4e59d2ec0eef33
```

What if we want to rewind history, so to speak? The `git checkout` command lets
us checkout at any point in the commit history, or even check out other tags. It
automatically adjusts the files, by replacing file content and adding or
deleting files as necessary.

```dvc
$ git checkout baseline
Note: checking out 'baseline'.
...
HEAD is now at 40cc182...
```

Let's check the `model.pkl` entry in `train.dvc` again:

```yaml
outs:
  md5: a66489653d1b6a8ba989799367b32c43
  path: model.pkl
```

But if you check `model.pkl`, the file hash is still the same:

```dvc
$ md5 model.pkl
MD5 (model.pkl) = 3863d0e317dee0a55c4e59d2ec0eef33
```

This is because `git checkout` changed `featurize.dvc`, `train.dvc`, and other
DVC-files. But it did nothing with the `model.pkl` and `matrix.pkl` files. Git
does not manage those files, DVC does, and we must therefore do this:

```dvc
$ dvc fetch
$ dvc checkout
$ md5 model.pkl
MD5 (model.pkl) = a66489653d1b6a8ba989799367b32c43
```

What happened is that DVC went through the sole existing DVC-file and adjusted
the current set of files to match the `outs` of that stage. `dvc fetch` command
runs once to download missing data from the remote storage to the local cache.
Alternatively, we could have just run `dvc pull` in this case to automatically
do `dvc fetch` + `dvc checkout`.

## Automating `dvc checkout`

We have the data files (managed by DVC) lined up with the other files (managed
by Git). This required us to remember to run `dvc checkout`, and of course we
won't always remember to do so. Wouldn't it be nice to automate this?

Let's run this command:

```dvc
$ dvc install
```

This installs Git hooks to automate running `dvc checkout` (or `dvc status`)
when needed. Then we can checkout the master branch again:

```dvc
$ git checkout bigrams
Previous HEAD position was d171a12 add evaluation stage
HEAD is now at d092b42 try using bigrams
Checking out model.pkl with cache '3863d0e317dee0a55c4e59d2ec0eef33'.

$ md5 model.pkl
MD5 (model.pkl) = 3863d0e317dee0a55c4e59d2ec0eef33
```

Previously this took two steps, `git checkout` followed by `dvc checkout`, but
we have skipped having to remember to run that second step. Instead it is
automatically executed for us, and the workspace is automatically synchronized.
