# Tools for Data Scientists

## Existing engineering tools

There is one common opinion regarding data science tooling. Data scientists as
engineers are supposed to use the best practices and collaboration software from
software engineering. Source code version control system (Git), continuous
integration services (CI), and unit test frameworks are all expected to be
utilized in data science pipelines.

But a comprehensive look at data science processes shows that the software
engineering toolset does not cover data science needs. Try to answer all the
questions from the above using only engineering tools, and you are likely to be
left wanting for more.

## Experiment management software

This new type of software was created to solve data scientists collaboration
issues. This software aims to cover the gap between data scientist needs and the
existing toolset.

Experiment management software is usually **graphical user interface** (GUI)
based, in contrast to existing command line engineering tools. The GUI is a
bridge to a separate **cloud based environment**. The cloud environment is
usually not so flexible as local data scientists environment. And the cloud
environment is not fully integrated with the local environment.

The separation of the local data scientist environment and the experimentation
cloud environment creates another discrepancy issue and the environment
synchronization requires addition work. Also, this style of software usually
require external services, typically accompanied with a monthly bill. This might
be a good solution for a particular companies or groups of data scientists.
However a more accessible, free tool is needed for a wider audience.
