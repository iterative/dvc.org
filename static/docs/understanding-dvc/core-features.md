# Core Features

1. DVC works **on top of Git repositories** and has a similar command line
   interface and Git workflow.

2. It makes data science projects **reproducible** by creating lightweight
   pipelines of DAGs.

3. **Large data file versioning** works by creating pointers in your Git
   repository to the data cache on a local hard drive.

4. **Programming language agnostic**: Python, R, Julia, shell scripts, etc. ML
   library agnostic: Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, scipy, etc.

5. **Open-sourced** and **Self-served**. DVC is free and does not require any
   additional services.

6. DVC supports cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage and GCP storage) for
   **data sources and pre-trained models sharing**.
