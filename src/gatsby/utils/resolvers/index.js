/** Source Path Resolver Builder
   This function makes Gatsby resolvers that connect a node to another node via
   frontmatter fields. Each relation is slightly different, but only slightly different.
   This builder exposes just enough functionality to get to any node tagged with
   a sourcePath field, even if it's added with `createNodeField`.

   {
     type: string
       This is the name of the node type your resolver will fetch.
     resolvePath: function?
       If provided, the path that will be resolved will be the return value of
       this function called with the field's original value.
       If not provided, the field is used as-is.
     makeFilter: function?
       If provided, the filter that will be used on the query that finds the
       foreign Node will be the result of this function called with the resolved
       source path.
       If not provided, a default filter for the Node's top level will be used.
   }
