# import

Download a file or directory from any <abbr>DVC project</abbr> or Git repository
(e.g. hosted on GitHub) into the <abbr>workspace</abbr>. This also creates a
[DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) with information about the data
source, which can later be used to [update](/doc/command-reference/update) the
import.

> See also `dvc get`, that corresponds to the first step this command performs
> (just download the data).

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc import [-h] [-q | -v] [-o [OUT]] [--rev [REV]] url path

positional arguments:
  url         URL of DVC project or Git repository to download from.
  path        Path to data within the repository.
```

## Description

Provides an easy way to reuse datasets, intermediate results, ML models, or
other files and directories tracked in another <abbr>DVC project</abbr> or Git
repository into the workspace. The `dvc import` command downloads such a
file or <abbr>artifact</abbr> in a way that it is tracked with DVC, so it can be
updated when the data source changes. (See `dvc update`.)

The `url` argument specifies the address of the Git repository containing the
source <abbr>project</abbr>. Both HTTP and SSH protocols are supported for
online repositories (e.g. `[user@]server:project.git`). `url` can also be a
local file system path to an "offline" repository (in this case and if it
doesn't have a default remote set up, instead of downloading, DVC will try to
copy the target data from the external source project or its
<abbr>cache</abbr>).

The `path` argument of this command is used to specify the location, within the
source repository at `url`, of the target(s) to be downloaded. It can point to
any file or directory in the source project, including <abbr>outputs</abbr>
tracked by DVC as well as files tracked by Git. Note that for the former, data
should be specified in one of the [DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format)
of the source repository. (In this case, a default
[DVC remote](/doc/command-reference/remote) needs to be configured in the
project, containing the actual data.)

> See `dvc import-url` to download and tack data from other supported URLs.

After running this command successfully, the imported data is placed in the
current working directory with its original file name e.g. `data.txt`. An
_import stage_ (DVC-file) is then created, extending the full file or directory
name of the imported data e.g. `data.txt.dvc` â€“ similar to having used `dvc run`
to generate the same output.

DVC-files support references to data in an external DVC repository (hosted on a
Git server). In such a DVC-file, the `deps` section specifies the `repo`-`url`
and data `path` fields, and the `outs` section contains the corresponding local
workspace `path` field. This is enough data about the imported data, to enable
DVC efficiently determining whether the local copy is out of date.

To actually [track the data](https://dvc.org/doc/get-started/add-files),
`git add` (and `git commit`) the import stage.

Note that import stages are considered always locked, meaning that if you run
`dvc repro`, they won't be updated. Use `dvc update` or
[re-import](#example-fixed-revisions-re-importing) them to update the downloaded
data artifact from the source project.

## Options

- `-o`, `--out` - specify a path (directory and/or file name) to the desired
  location to place the imported data in. The default value (when this option
  isn't used) is the current working directory (`.`) and original file name. If
  an existing directory is specified, then the output will be placed inside of
  it.

- `--rev` - specific
  [Git revision](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)
  (such as a branch name, a tag, or a commit hash) of the DVC repository to
  import the data from. The tip of the repository's default branch is used by
  default when this option is not specified. Note that this adds a `rev` field
  in the import stage that fixes it to this revision. This can impact the
  behavior of `dvc update`. (See **re-importing** example below.)

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

A simple case for this command is to import a dataset from an external <abbr>DVC
repository</abbr>, such as our
[get started example repo](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started).

```dvc
$ dvc import git@github.com:iterative/example-get-started \
             data/data.xml
Importing 'data/data.xml (git@github.com:iterative/example-get-started)'
-> 'data.xml'
```

In contrast with `dvc get`, this command doesn't just download the data file,
but it also creates an import stage
([DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format)) with a link to the data source (as
explained in the description above). (This import stage can later be used to
[update](/doc/command-reference/update) the import.) Check `data.xml.dvc`:

```yaml
md5: 7de90e7de7b432ad972095bc1f2ec0f8
wdir: .
deps:
  - path: data/data.xml
    repo:
      url: git@github.com:iterative/example-get-started
      rev_lock: 6c73875a5f5b522f90b5afa9ab12585f64327ca7
outs:
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: data.xml
    cache: true
    metric: false
    persist: false
```

Several of the values above are pulled from the original stage file
`model.pkl.dvc` in the external DVC repository. The `url` and `rev_lock`
subfields under `repo` are used to save the origin and version of the
dependency.

## Example: fixed revisions & re-importing

To import a specific revision of a <abbr>data artifact</abbr>, we may use the
`--rev` option:

```dvc
$ dvc import --rev cats-dogs-v1 \
             git@github.com:iterative/dataset-registry.git \
             use-cases/cats-dogs
Importing
'use-cases/cats-dogs (git@github.com:iterative/dataset-registry.git)'
-> 'cats-dogs'
```

When using this option, the import stage
([DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format)) will also have a `rev` subfield
under `repo`:

```yaml
deps:
  - path: data/data.xml
    repo:
      url: git@github.com:iterative/dataset-registry.git
      rev: cats-dogs-v1
      rev_lock: 0547f5883fb18e523e35578e2f0d19648c8f2d5c
```

If the
[Git revision](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)
moves (e.g. a branch), you may use `dvc update` to bring the data up to date.
However, for typically static references (e.g. tags), or for SHA commits, in
order to actually "update" an import, it's necessary to **re-import the data**
instead, by using `dvc import` again without or with a different `--rev`. This
will overwrite the import stage (DVC-file), either removing or replacing the
`rev` field, respectively. This can produce an import stage that is able to be
updated normally with `dvc update` going forward. For example:

```dvc
$ dvc import --rev master \
             git@github.com:iterative/dataset-registry.git \
             use-cases/cats-dogs
```

> In the above example, the value for `rev` in the new import stage will be
> `master`, which happens to be the default branch in this Git repository, so
> the command is equivalent to not using `--rev` at all.

## Example: Data registry

If you take a look at our
[dataset-registry](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry)
<abbr>project</abbr>, you'll see that it's organized into different directories
such as `tutorial/ver` and `use-cases/`, and these contain
[DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) that track different datasets.
Given this simple structure, these files can be easily shared among several
other projects, using `dvc get` and `dvc import`. For example:

```dvc
$ dvc get https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry \
          tutorial/ver/data.zip
```

> Used in our [versioning tutorial](/doc/tutorials/versioning)

Or

```dvc
$ dvc import git@github.com:iterative/dataset-registry.git \
             use-cases/cats-dogs
```

`dvc import` provides a better way to incorporate data files tracked in external
<abbr>DVC repositories</abbr> because it saves the connection between the
current project and the source project. This means that enough information is
recorded in an import stage (DVC-file) in order to
[reproduce](/doc/command-reference/repro) downloading of this same data version
in the future, where and when needed. This is achieved with the `repo` field,
for example (matching the import command above):

```yaml
md5: 96fd8e791b0ee4824fc1ceffd13b1b49
locked: true
deps:
  - path: use-cases/cats-dogs
    repo:
      url: git@github.com:iterative/dataset-registry.git
      rev_lock: 0547f5883fb18e523e35578e2f0d19648c8f2d5c
outs:
  - md5: b6923e1e4ad16ea1a7e2b328842d56a2.dir
    path: cats-dogs
    cache: true
    metric: false
    persist: false
```
