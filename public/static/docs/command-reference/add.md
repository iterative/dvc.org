# add

Take a data file or a directory under DVC control (by creating a corresponding
[DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format)).

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc add [-h] [-q | -v] [-R] [--no-commit] [-f FILE]
               targets [targets ...]

positional arguments:
  targets               Input files/directories to add.
```

## Description

The `dvc add` command is analogous to the `git add` command. By default though,
an added file or directory is also committed to the <abbr>cache</abbr>. (Use the
`--no-commit` option to avoid this, and `dvc commit` as a separate step when
ready.)

The `targets` are files or directories to be places under DVC control. These are
turned into <abbr>outputs<abbr> (`outs` field) in a resulting
[DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format). (See steps below for more details.)
Note that target data outside the current <abbr>workspace</abbr> is supported,
that becomes [external outputs](/doc/user-guide/managing-external-data).

Under the hood, a few actions are taken for each file (or directory) in
`targets`:

1. Calculate the file checksum.
2. Move the file contents to the cache directory (by default in `.dvc/cache`),
   using the checksum to form the cached file names. (See
   [Structure of cache directory](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#structure-of-cache-directory)
   for more details.)
3. Attempt to replace the file by a link to the file in cache (more details
   below).
4. Create a corresponding DVC-file and store the checksum to identify the cached
   file. Unless the `-f` option is used, the DVC-file name generated by default
   is `<file>.dvc`, where `<file>` is the file name of the first target.
5. Unless `dvc init --no-scm` was used when initializing the project, add the
   `targets` to `.gitignore` in order to prevent them from being committed to
   the Git repository.
6. Unless `dvc init --no-scm` was used when initializing the project,
   instructions are printed showing `git` commands for adding the files to a Git
   repository.

The result is that the target data gets cached by DVC, and instead small
DVC-files can be tracked with Git. The DVC-file lists the added file as an
output (`outs` field), and references the cached file using the checksum. See
[DVC-File Format](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) for more details.

> Note that DVC-files created by this command are considered _orphans_ because
> they have no dependencies, only outputs. These _orphan_ "stage files" are
> always treated as _changed_ by `dvc repro`, which always executes them. See
> `dvc run` to learn about regular stage files.

By default DVC tries to use reflinks (see
[File link types](/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization#file-link-types-for-the-dvc-cache)
to avoid copying any file contents and to optimize DVC-file operations for large
files. DVC also supports other link types for use on file systems without
`reflink` support, but they have to be specified manually. Refer to the
`cache.type` config option in `dvc config cache` for more information.

A `dvc add` target can be an individual file or a directory. There are two ways
to work with directory hierarchies with `dvc add`:

1. With `dvc add --recursive`, the hierarchy is traversed and every file is
   added individually as described above. This means every file has its own
   DVC-file, and a corresponding cached file is created (unless the
   `--no-commit` flag is used).
2. When not using `--recursive` a DVC-file is created for the top of the
   directory (with default name `dirname.dvc`). Every file in the hierarchy is
   added to the cache (unless `--no-commit` flag is added), but DVC does not
   produce individual DVC-files for each file in the directory tree. Instead,
   the single DVC-file points to a file in the cache that contains references to
   the files in the added hierarchy.

In a <abbr>DVC project</abbr>, `dvc add` can be used to version control any
<abbr>data artifact</abbr> (input, intermediate, or output files and
directories, and model files). It is useful by itself to go back and forth
between different versions of datasets or models. We recommend using `dvc run`
and `dvc repro` mechanism to version control intermediate and final results
(like models) though. This way you bring data provenance and make your project
reproducible.

## Options

- `-R`, `--recursive` - `targets` is expected to contain one or more directories
  for this option to have effect. Determines the files to add by searching each
  target directory and its subdirectories for data files. For each file found, a
  new DVC-file is created using the process described in this command's
  description.

- `--no-commit` - do not save outputs to cache. A DVC-file is created, and an
  entry is added to `.dvc/state`, while nothing is added to the cache. (The
  `dvc status` command will report that the file is `not in cache`.) This is
  analogous to using `git add` before `git commit`. Use `dvc commit` when ready
  to commit the results to cache.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

- `-f`, `--file` - specify name of the DVC-file it generates. This option works
  only if there is a single target. By default the name of the generated
  DVC-file is `<target>.dvc`, where `<target>` is the file name of the given
  target. This option allows to set the name and the path of the generated
  DVC-file.

## Example: Single file

Take a file under DVC control:

```dvc
$ dvc add data.xml

Saving information to 'data.xml.dvc'.

To track the changes with git run:

	git add .gitignore data.xml.dvc
```

As the output says, a [DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) has been
created for `data.xml`. Let's explore the result:

```dvc
$ tree
.
├── data.xml
└── data.xml.dvc
```

Let's check the `data.xml.dvc` file inside:

```yaml
md5: aae37d74224b05178153acd94e15956b
outs:
  - cache: true
    md5: d8acabbfd4ee51c95da5d7628c7ef74b
    metric: false
    path: data.xml
meta: # Special field to contain arbitary user data
  name: John
  email: john@xyz.com
```

This is a standard DVC-file with only an `outs` entry. The checksum should
correspond to an entry in the <abbr>cache</abbr>.

> Note that the `meta` values above were entered manually for this example. Meta
> values and `#` comments are not preserved when a DVC-file is overwritten with
> the `dvc add`, `dvc run`, `dvc import`, or `dvc import-url` commands.

```dvc
$ file .dvc/cache/d8/acabbfd4ee51c95da5d7628c7ef74b

.dvc/cache/d8/acabbfd4ee51c95da5d7628c7ef74b: ASCII text
```

Note that tracking compressed files (e.g. ZIP or TAR archives) is not
recommended, as `dvc add` supports tracking directories. (Details below.)

## Example: Directory

Let's suppose your goal is to build an algorithm to identify cats and dogs in
pictures. You may then have hundreds or thousands of pictures of these animals
in a directory, and this is your training dataset:

```dvc
$ tree pics --filelimit 3
pics
├── train
│   ├── cats [many image files]
│   └── dogs [many image files]
└── validation
    ├── cats [more image files]
    └── dogs [more image files]
```

Taking a directory under DVC control as simple as with a single file:

```dvc
$ dvc add pics
Computing md5 for a large number of files. This is only done once.
...
Linking directory 'pics'.

Saving information to 'pics.dvc'.
...
```

There are no [DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) generated within this
directory structure, but the images are all added to the <abbr>cache</abbr>. DVC
prints a message about this, mentioning that `md5` values are computed for each
directory. A single `pics.dvc` DVC-file is generated for the top-level
directory, and it contains:

```yaml
md5: df06d8d51e6483ed5a74d3979f8fe42e
outs:
  - cache: true
    md5: b8f4d5a78e55e88906d5f4aeaf43802e.dir
    metric: false
    path: pics
wdir: .
```

> The cache file with `.dir` extension is a special text file that records the
> mapping of files in the `pics/` directory. (Refer to
> [Structure of cache directory](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#structure-of-cache-directory)
> for an example.)

This allows us to treat the entire directory structure as one unit (a dependency
or an <abbr>output</abbr>) with DVC commands. For example, it lets you pass the
whole directory tree as a dependency to a `dvc run` stage definition:

```dvc
$ dvc run -f train.dvc \
          -d train.py -d pics \
          -M metrics.json -o model.h5 \
          python train.py
```

> To follow the full example, see
> [Tutorial: Versioning](/doc/tutorials/versioning).

If instead we use the `--recursive` (`-R`) option, the output looks like this:

```dvc
$ dvc add -R pics
Saving information to 'pics/cat1.jpg.dvc'.
Saving information to 'pics/cat3.jpg.dvc'.
Saving information to 'pics/cat2.jpg.dvc'.
Saving information to 'pics/cat4.jpg.dvc'.
...
```

In this case, a DVC-file is generated for each file in the `pics/` directory
tree. No top-level DVC-file is generated, which is typically less convenient.
For example, we cannot use the directory structure as one unit with `dvc run` or
other commands.
