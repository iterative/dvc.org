# repro

Reproduce complete or partial [pipelines](/doc/command-reference/pipeline) by
executing commands defined in their [stages](/doc/command-reference/run), in the
correct order. The commands to be executed are determined by recursively
analyzing dependencies and <abbr>outputs</abbr> of the target stages.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc repro [-h] [-q | -v] [-f] [-s] [-c CWD] [-m] [--dry] [-i]
                 [-p] [-P] [-R] [--ignore-build-cache] [--no-commit]
                 [--downstream] [targets [targets ...]]

positional arguments:
  targets               DVC-file to reproduce. 'Dvcfile' by default.
```

## Description

`dvc repro` provides an way to regenerate data pipeline results, by restoring
the dependency graph (a
[DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)) implicitly defined
by the [stage files](/doc/command-reference/run) (DVC-files with dependencies)
that are found in the <abbr>project</abbr>. The commands defined in these stages
can then be executed in the correct order, reproducing pipeline results.

> Pipeline stages are typically defined using the `dvc run` command, while
> initial data dependencies can be registered by the `dvc add` command.

ðŸ’¡ For convenience, a Git hook is available to remind you to `dvc repro` when
needed after a `git commit`. See `dvc install` for more details.

There's a few ways to restrict the stages that will be regenerated by this
command: by specifying stage file `targets`, or by using the `--single-item`,
`--cwd`, or other options.

If specific [DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) (`targets`) are
omitted, `Dvcfile` will be assumed.

`dvc repro` does not run `dvc fetch`, `dvc pull` or `dvc checkout` to get data
files, intermediate or final results.

By default, this command recursively searches in pipeline stages, starting from
the `targets`, to determine which ones have changed. Then it executes the
corresponding commands.<br/> Note that DVC removes cached <abbr>outputs</abbr>
before running the stages that produce them.

It saves all the data files, intermediate or final results into the <abbr>DVC
cache</abbr> (unless the `--no-commit` option is used), and updates the hash
values of changed dependencies and outputs in the corresponding stage files.

### Parallel stage execution

Currently, `dvc repro` is not able to parallelize stage execution automatically.
If you need to do this, you can launch `dvc repro` multiple times manually. For
example, let's say a <abbr>pipeline</abbr> graph looks something like this:

```
$ dvc pipeline show --ascii result.py
+--------+          +--------+
| A1.dvc |          | B1.dvc |
+--------+          +--------+
     *                   *
     *                   *
     *                   *
+--------+          +--------+
| A2.dvc |          | B2.dvc |
+--------+          +--------+
          *         *
           **     **
             *   *
        +------------+
        | result.dvc |
        +------------+
```

This pipeline consists of two parallel branches (`A` and `B`), and the final
"result" stage, where the branches merge. To reproduce both branches at the same
time, you could run `dvc repro A2.dvc` and `dvc repro B2.dvc` at the same time
(e.g. in separate terminals). After both finish successfully, you can then run
`dvc repro result.dvc`: DVC will know that both branches are already up-to-date
and only execute the final stage.

## Options

- `-f`, `--force` - reproduce a pipeline, regenerating its results, even if no
  changes were found. By default this executes all of its stages but it can be
  limited with the `targets` argument and `-s`, `-p`, or `-c` options.

- `-s`, `--single-item` - reproduce only a single stage by turning off the
  recursive search for changed dependencies. Multiple stages are executed
  (non-recursively) if multiple stage files are given as `targets`.

- `-c`, `--cwd` - directory within the project to reproduce from. If no
  `targets` are given, it attempts to use `Dvcfile` in the specified directory.
  Instead of using `--cwd`, one can alternately specify a target in a
  subdirectory as `path/to/target.dvc`. This option can be useful for example
  with subdirectories containing a separate pipeline that can either be
  reproduced as part of the pipeline in the parent directory, or as an
  independent unit.

- `-R`, `--recursive` - determines the stages to reproduce by searching each
  target directory and its subdirectories for DVC-files to inspect. `targets` is
  expected to contain one or more directories for this option to have effect.

- `--no-commit` - do not save outputs to cache. (See `dvc run`.) Useful when
  running different experiments and you don't want to fill up the cache with
  temporary files. Use `dvc commit` when ready to commit the results to cache.

- `-m`, `--metrics` - show metrics after reproduction. The target pipelines must
  have at least one metric file defined either with the `dvc metrics` command,
  or by the `-M` or `-m` options on the `dvc run` command.

- `--dry` - only print the commands that would be executed without actually
  executing the commands.

- `-i`, `--interactive` - ask for confirmation before reproducing each stage.
  The stage is only executed if the user types "y".

- `-p`, `--pipeline` - reproduce the entire pipelines that the stage file
  `targets` belong to. Use `dvc pipeline show <target>.dvc` to show the parent
  pipeline of a target stage.

- `-P`, `--all-pipelines` - reproduce all pipelines, for all the stage files
  present in `DVC` repository.

- `--ignore-build-cache` - in cases like `... -> A (changed) -> B -> C` it will
  reproduce `A` first and then `B`, even if `B` was previously executed with the
  same inputs from `A` (cached). To be precise, it reproduces all descendants of
  a changed stage or the stages following the changed stage, even if their
  direct dependencies did not change.

  It can be useful when we have a common dependency among all stages, and want
  to specify it only once (for stage `A` here). For example, if we know that all
  stages (`A` and below) depend on `requirements.txt`, we can specify it in `A`,
  and omit it in `B` and `C`.

  Like with the same option on `dvc run`, this is a way to force-execute stages
  without changes. This can also be useful for pipelines containing stages that
  produce non-deterministic (semi-random) outputs, where outputs can vary on
  each execution, meaning the cache cannot be trusted for such stages.

- `--downstream` - only execute the stages after the given `targets` in their
  corresponding pipelines, including the target stages themselves.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if all
  stages are up to date or if all stages are successfully executed, otherwise
  exit with 1. The command defined in the stage is free to write output
  irregardless of this flag.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

For simplicity, let's build a pipeline defined below. (If you want get your
hands-on something more real, see this shot
[pipeline tutorial](/doc/tutorials/pipelines)). It takes this `text.txt` file:

```
dvc
1231
is
3
the
best
```

And runs a few simple transformations to filter and count numbers:

```dvc
$ dvc run -f filter.dvc -d text.txt -o numbers.txt \
           "cat text.txt | egrep '[0-9]+' > numbers.txt"

$ dvc run -f Dvcfile -d numbers.txt -d process.py -M count.txt \
           "python process.py numbers.txt > count.txt"
```

> Note that using `-f Dvcfile` with `dvc run` above is optional, the stage file
> name would otherwise default to `count.txt.dvc`. We use `Dvcfile` in this
> example because that's the default stage file name `dvc repro` will read
> without having to provide any `targets`.

Where `process.py` is a script that, for simplicity, just prints the number of
lines:

```python
import sys
num_lines = 0
with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        num_lines += 1
print(num_lines)
```

The result of executing these `dvc run` commands should look like this:

```dvc
$ tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Dvcfile        <---- second stage with a default DVC name
â”œâ”€â”€ count.txt      <---- result: "2"
â”œâ”€â”€ filter.dvc     <---- first stage
â”œâ”€â”€ numbers.txt    <---- intermediate result of the first stage
â”œâ”€â”€ process.py     <---- code that implements data transformation
â””â”€â”€ text.txt       <---- text file to process
```

You may want to check the contents of `Dvcfile` and `count.txt` for later
reference.

Ok, now, let's run the `dvc repro` command (remember, by default it reproduces
<abbr>outputs</abbr> tracked in `Dvcfile`, in this case `count.txt`):

```dvc
$ dvc repro
WARNING: assuming default target 'Dvcfile'.
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

It makes sense, since we haven't changed neither of the dependencies this
pipeline has: `text.txt` or `process.py`. Now, let's imagine we want to print a
description and we add this line to the `process.py`:

```python
...
print('Number of lines:')
print(num_lines)
```

If we now run `dvc repro`, that's what we should see:

```dvc
$ dvc repro
WARNING: assuming default target 'Dvcfile'.
Stage 'Dvcfile' changed.
Reproducing 'Dvcfile'
Running command:
  python process.py numbers.txt > count.txt
Output 'count.txt' doesn't use cache. Skipping saving.
Saving information to 'Dvcfile'.
```

You can now check that `Dvcfile` and `count.txt` have been updated with the new
information and updated dependency/output file checksums, and a new result,
respectively.

## Example: Downstream

The `--downstream` option allows us to only reproduce results from commands
after a specific stage in a pipeline. To demonstrate how it works, let's make a
change in `text.txt` (the input of our first stage, created in the previous
example):

```
...
The answer to universe is 42
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the  Galaxy
```

Now, using the `--downstream` option results in the following output:

```dvc
$ dvc repro --downstream
WARNING: assuming default target 'Dvcfile'.
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

The reason being that the `text.txt` file is a dependency in the target
[DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) (`Dvcfile` by default). This
`Dvcfile` stage is dependent on `filter.dvc`, which happens first in this
pipeline (shown in the following figure):

```dvc
$ dvc pipeline show --ascii

    .------------.
    | filter.dvc |
    `------------'
           *
           *
           *
      .---------.
      | Dvcfile |
      `---------'
```
