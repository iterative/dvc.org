# commit

Record changes to the repository by updating
[DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) and saving <abbr>outputs<abbr> to
the <abbr>cache</abbr>.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc commit [-h] [-q | -v] [-f] [-d] [-R]
                  [targets [targets ...]]

positional arguments:
  targets          DVC-files to commit. Optional. (Finds all
                   DVC-files in the workspace by default.)
```

## Description

The `dvc commit` command is useful for several scenarios where a dataset is
being changed: when a [stage](/doc/command-reference/run) or
[pipeline](/doc/command-reference/pipeline) is in development, when one wishes
to run commands outside the control of DVC, or to force DVC-file updates to save
time tying stages or a pipeline.

- Code or data for a stage is under active development, with rapid iteration of
  code, configuration, or data. Run DVC commands (`dvc run`, `dvc repro`, and
  even `dvc add`) using the `--no-commit` option to avoid caching unnecessary
  data over and over again. Use `dvc commit` when the files are finalized.

- One can always execute the code used in a stage without using DVC (keep in
  mind that output files or directories in certain cases must first be
  unprotected or removed, see `dvc unprotect`). Or one could be developing code
  or data, repeatedly manually executing the code until it is working. Once it
  is finished, use `dvc add`, `dvc commit`, or `dvc run` when appropriate to
  update DVC-files and to store data to the cache.

- Sometimes we want to clean up a code or configuration file in a way that
  doesn't cause a change in its results. We might write in-line documentation
  with comments, change indentation, remove some debugging printouts, or any
  other change that doesn't produce different <abbr>outputs<abbr> of pipeline
  stages. `dvc commit` can help avoid having to reproduce a pipeline in these
  cases by forcing the update of the DVC-files.

Let's take a look at what is happening in the fist scenario closely. Normally
DVC commands like `dvc add`, `dvc repro` or `dvc run` commit the data to the
<abbr>cache</abbr> after creating a DVC-file. What _commit_ means is that DVC:

- Computes a checksum for the file/directory.
- Enters the checksum and file name into the DVC-file.
- Tells Git to ignore the file/directory (adding an entry to `.gitignore`).
  (Note that if the <abbr>project</abbr> was initialized with no SCM support
  (`dvc init --no-scm`), this does not happen.)
- Adds the file/directory or to the cache.

There are many cases where the last step is not desirable (for example rapid
iterations on an experiment). The `--no-commit` option prevents the last step
from occurring (on the commands where it's available), saving time and space by
not storing unwanted <abbr>data artifacts</abbr>. Checksums is still computed
and added to the DVC-file, but the actual data file is not saved in the cache.
This is where the `dvc commit` command comes into play. It performs that last
step (saving the data in cache).

Note that it's best to avoid the last two scenarios. They essentially
force-update the [DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) and save data to
cache. They are still useful, but keep in mind that DVC can't guarantee
reproducibility in those cases.

## Options

- `-d`, `--with-deps` - one or more `targets` should be specified for this
  option to have effect. Determines files to commit by tracking dependencies to
  the target DVC-files (stages). By traversing all stage dependencies, DVC
  searches backward from the target stages in the corresponding pipelines. This
  means DVC will not commit files referenced in later stages than the `targets`.

- `-R`, `--recursive` - `targets` is expected to contain one or more directories
  for this option to have effect. Determines the files to commit by searching
  each target directory and its subdirectories for DVC-files to inspect.

- `-f`, `--force` - commit data even if checksums for dependencies or outputs
  did not change.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information from executing the
  `dvc add` command.

## Examples

Let's employ a simple <abbr>workspace</abbr> with some data, code, ML models,
pipeline stages, such as the <abbr>DVC project</abbr> created in our
[Get Started](/doc/get-started) section. Then we can see what happens with
`git commit` and `dvc commit` in different situations.

### Click and expand to setup the project

Start by cloning our example repo if you don't already have it:

```dvc
$ git clone https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started
$ cd example-get-started
```

Now let's install the requirements. But before we do that, we **strongly**
recommend creating a
[virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments):

```dvc
$ virtualenv -p python3 .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

Download the precomputed data using:

```dvc
$ dvc pull --all-branches --all-tags
```

</details>

## Example: Rapid iterations

Sometimes we want to iterate through multiple changes to configuration, code, or
data, trying multiple options to improve the output of a stage. To avoid filling
the <abbr>cache</abbr> with undesired intermediate results, we can run a single
stage with `dvc run --no-commit`, or reproduce an entire pipeline using
`dvc repro --no-commit`. This prevents data from being pushed to cache. When
development of the stage is finished, `dvc commit` can be used to store data
files in the cache.

In the `featurize.dvc` stage, `src/featurize.py` is executed. A useful change to
make is adjusting a parameter to `CountVectorizer` in that script. Namely,
adjusting the `max_features` option in this line changes the resulting model:

```python
bag_of_words = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english',
            max_features=6000, ngram_range=(1, 2))
```

This option not only changes the trained model, it also introduces a change that
would cause the `featurize.dvc`, `train.dvc` and `evaluate.dvc` stages to
execute if we ran `dvc repro`. But if we want to try several values for this
option and save only the best result to the cache, we can execute as so:

```dvc
$ dvc repro --no-commit evaluate.dvc
```

We can run this command as many times as we like, editing `featurize.py` any way
we like, and so long as we use `--no-commit`, the data does not get saved to the
cache. Let's verify that's the case:

First verification:

```dvc
$ dvc status

evaluate.dvc:
    changed deps:
        modified:           data/features
        modified:           model.pkl
train.dvc:
    changed outs:
        not in cache:       model.pkl
```

Now we can look in the cache directory to see if the new version of `model.pkl`
is indeed _not in cache_ as claimed. Look at `train.dvc` first:

```yaml
cmd: python src/train.py data/features model.pkl
deps:
  - md5: d05e0201a3fb47c878defea65bd85e4d
    path: src/train.py
  - md5: b7a357ba7fa6b726e615dd62b34190b4.dir
    path: data/features
md5: b91b22bfd8d9e5af13e8f48523e80250
outs:
  - cache: true
    md5: 70599f166c2098d7ffca91a369a78b0d
    metric: false
    path: model.pkl
    persist: false
wdir: .
```

To verify this instance of `model.pkl` is not in the cache, we must know the
path to the cached file. In the cache directory, the first two characters of the
checksum are used as a subdirectory name, and the remaining characters are the
file name. Therefore, had the file been committed to the cache, it would appear
in the directory `.dvc/cache/70`. Let's check:

```dvc
$ ls .dvc/cache/70
ls: .dvc/cache/70: No such file or directory
```

If we've determined the changes to `featurize.py` were successful, we can
execute this set of commands:

```dvc
$ dvc commit
$ dvc status
Data and pipelines are up to date.
$ ls .dvc/cache/70
599f166c2098d7ffca91a369a78b0d
```

We've verified that `dvc commit` has saved the changes into the cache, and that
the new instance of `model.pkl` is there.

## Example: Running commands without DVC

It is also possible to execute the commands that are executed by `dvc repro` by
hand. You won't have DVC helping you, but you have the freedom to run any
command you like, even ones not defined in a
[DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format). For example:

```dvc
$ python src/featurization.py data/prepared data/features
$ python src/train.py data/features model.pkl
$ python src/evaluate.py model.pkl data/features auc.metric
```

As before, `dvc status` will show which files have changed, and when your work
is finalized `dvc commit` will commit everything to the <abbr>cache</abbr>.

## Example: Updating dependencies

Sometimes we want to clean up a code or configuration file in a way that doesn't
cause a change in its results. We might write in-line documentation with
comments, change indentation, remove some debugging printouts, or any other
change that doesn't produce different output of pipeline stages.

```dvc
$ git status -s
M src/train.py

$ dvc status

train.dvc:
    changed deps:
        modified:           src/train.py
```

Let's edit one of the source code files. It doesn't matter which one. You'll see
that both Git and DVC recognize a change was made.

If we ran `dvc repro` at this point, this pipeline would be reproduced. But
since the change was inconsequential, that would be a waste of time and CPU.
That's especially critical if the corresponding stages lots of resources to
execute.

```dvc
$ git add src/train.py

$ git commit -m "CHANGED"
[master 72327bd] CHANGED
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

$ dvc commit
dependencies ['src/train.py'] of 'train.dvc' changed.
Are you sure you commit it? [y/n] y

$ dvc status

Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

Nothing special is required, we simply `commit` to both the SCM and DVC. Since
this pipeline is up to date, `dvc repro` will not do anything.
