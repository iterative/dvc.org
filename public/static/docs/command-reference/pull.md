# pull

Downloads missing files and directories from
[remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote) to the <abbr>cache</abbr> based
on [DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) in the <abbr>workspace</abbr>,
then links the downloaded files into the workspace.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc pull [-h] [-q | -v] [-j JOBS] [--show-checksums]
                [-r REMOTE] [-a] [-T] [-d] [-f] [-R]
                [targets [targets ...]]

positional arguments:
  targets        Limit command scope to these DVC-files. Using -R,
                 directories to search DVC-files in can also be given.
```

## Description

The `dvc pull` and `dvc push` commands are the means for uploading and
downloading data to and from remote storage. These commands are analogous to the
`git pull` and `git push` commands.
[Data sharing](/doc/use-cases/sharing-data-and-model-files) across environments
and preserving data versions (input datasets, intermediate results, models,
[metrics](/doc/command-reference/metrics), etc) remotely (S3, SSH, GCS, etc.)
are the most common use cases for these commands.

The `dvc pull` command allows one to retrieve data from remote storage.
`dvc pull` has the same effect as running `dvc fetch` and `dvc checkout`
immediately after that.

If the `--remote REMOTE` option is not specified, then the default remote,
configured with the `core.config` config option, is used. See `dvc remote`,
`dvc config` and this [example](/doc/get-started/configure) for more information
on how to configure a remote.

With no arguments, just `dvc pull` or `dvc pull --remote REMOTE`, it downloads
only the files (or directories) missing from the workspace by searching all
[DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) currently in the
<abbr>project</abbr>. It will not download files associated with earlier
versions or branches of the repository if using Git, nor will it download files
that have not changed.

The command `dvc status -c` can list files referenced in current DVC-files, but
missing in the <abbr>cache</abbr>. It can be used to see what files `dvc pull`
would download.

If one or more `targets` are specified, DVC only considers the files associated
with those DVC-files. Using the `--with-deps` option, DVC tracks dependencies
backward from the target [stage files](/doc/command-reference/run), through the
corresponding [pipelines](/doc/command-reference/pipeline), to find data files
to pull.

After a data file is in cache, `dvc pull` can use OS-specific mechanisms like
reflinks or hardlinks to put it in the workspace without copying. See
`dvc checkout` for more details.

## Options

- `-r REMOTE`, `--remote REMOTE` specifies which remote to pull from (see
  `dvc remote list`). The value for `REMOTE` is a name defined using
  `dvc remote`. If the option is not specified, then the default remote
  (configured with the `core.config` config option) is used.

- `-a`, `--all-branches` - determines the files to download by examining
  DVC-files in all Git branches of the project repository (if using Git). It's
  useful if branches are used to track experiments or project checkpoints.

- `-T`, `--all-tags` - the same as `-a`, `--all-branches` but Git tags are used
  to save different experiments or project checkpoints. Note that both options
  can be combined, for example using the `-aT` flag.

- `-d`, `--with-deps` - one or more `targets` should be specified for this
  option to have effect. Determines files to download by tracking dependencies
  to the target DVC-files (stages). By traversing all stage dependencies, DVC
  searches backward from the target stages in the corresponding pipelines. This
  means DVC will not pull files referenced in later stages than the `targets`.

- `-R`, `--recursive` - `targets` is expected to contain one or more directories
  for this option to have effect. Determines the files to pull by searching each
  target directory and its subdirectories for DVC-files to inspect.

- `-f`, `--force` - does not prompt when removing workspace files, which occurs
  when these file no longer match the current DVC-file references. This option
  surfaces behavior from the `dvc fetch` and `dvc checkout` commands because
  `dvc pull` in effect performs those 2 functions in a single command.

- `-j JOBS`, `--jobs JOBS` - specifies number of jobs to run simultaneously
  while downloading files from the remote. The effect is to control the number
  of files downloaded simultaneously. Default is `4 * cpu_count()`. For example
  with `-j 1` DVC downloads one file at a time, with `-j 2` it downloads two at
  a time, and so forth. For SSH remotes default is set to 4.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

For using the `dvc pull` command, a remote storage must be defined. (See
`dvc remote add`.) For an existing <abbr>project</abbr>, remotes are usually
already set up and you can use `dvc remote list` to check them. To remember how
it's done, and set a context for the example, let's define a default SSH remote:

```dvc
$ dvc remote add -d r1 ssh://_username_@_host_/path/to/dvc/remote/storage
$ dvc remote list
r1	ssh://_username_@_host_/path/to/dvc/remote/storage
```

> DVC supports several
> [remote types](/doc/command-reference/remote/add#supported-storage-types).

Having some images and other files in remote storage, we can pull all changed
files from the current Git branch:

```dvc
$ dvc pull --remote r1
```

We can download specific files that are <abbr>outputs</abbr> of a specific
DVC-file:

```dvc
$ dvc pull data.zip.dvc
```

In this case we left off the `--remote` option, so it will have pulled from the
default remote. The only files considered in this case are what is listed in the
`out` section of the DVC-file `targets`.

## Example: With dependencies

Demonstrating the `--with-deps` flag requires a larger example. First, assume a
[pipeline](/doc/command-reference/pipeline) has been setup with these
[stages](/doc/command-reference/run):

```dvc
$ dvc pipeline show

data/Posts.xml.zip.dvc
Posts.xml.dvc
Posts.tsv.dvc
Posts-test.tsv.dvc
matrix-train.p.dvc
model.p.dvc
Dvcfile
```

Imagine the remote storage has been modified such that the data in some of these
stages should be updated in the <abbr>workspace</abbr>.

```dvc
$ dvc status --cloud

  deleted:            data/model.p
  deleted:            data/matrix-test.p
  deleted:            data/matrix-train.p
```

One could do a simple `dvc pull` to get all the data, but what if you only want
to retrieve part of the data?

```dvc
$ dvc pull --remote r1 --with-deps matrix-train.p.dvc

... Do some work based on the partial update

$ dvc pull --remote r1 --with-deps model.p.dvc

... Pull the rest of the data

$ dvc pull --remote r1

Everything is up to date.
```

With the first `dvc pull` we specified a stage in the middle of this pipeline
(`matrix-train.p.dvc`) while using `--with-deps`. DVC started with that DVC-file
and searched backwards through the pipeline for data files to download. Because
the `model.p.dvc` stage occurs later, its data was not pulled.

Then we ran `dvc pull` specifying the last stage, `model.p.dvc`, and its data
was downloaded. Finally, we ran `dvc pull` with no options to make sure that all
data was already pulled with the previous commands.
