# Shared Development Server

Some teams may prefer using one single shared machine to run their experiments.
This allows better resource utilization, such as the ability to use multiple
GPUs, centralized data storage, etc. With DVC, you can easily setup shared data
storage on a server accessed by several users, in a way that enables almost
instantaneous <abbr>workspace</abbr> restoration/switching speed for everyone â€“
similar to `git checkout` for your code.

## Preparation

Create a shared directory to be used as the <abbr>cache</abbr> location for
everyone's <abbr>DVC projects</abbr>, so that all your colleagues can use the
same project cache:

```dvc
$ mkdir -p /path/to/dvc-cache
```

You will have to make sure that the directory has proper permissions setup, so
that all your colleagues can read and write to it, and can access cache files
written by others. The most straightforward way to do this is to make sure that
everyone's users are members of the same group, and that your shared cache
directory is owned by this group, with the aforementioned permissions.

## Transfer existing cache (Optional)

This step is optional. You can skip it if you are setting up a new DVC project
whose cache directory is not stored in the default location, `.dvc/cache`. If
you did work on your project with DVC previously and you wish to transfer your
cache to the shared cache directory (external to your workspace), you will need
to simply move it from an old cache location to the new one:

```dvc
$ mv .dvc/cache/* /path/to/dvc-cache
```

Now you need to ensure that cache files/directories have appropriate
permissions, so that they could be accessed by your collegues that are members
of the same group:

```dvc
$ sudo find /path/to/dvc-cache -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;
$ sudo find /path/to/dvc-cache -type d -exec chmod 0775 {} \;
$ sudo chown -R myuser:ourgroup /path/to/dvc-cache/
```

## Configure shared cache

Tell DVC to use the directory we've set up above as an shared cache location by
running:

```dvc
$ dvc config cache.dir /path/to/dvc-cache
```

And tell DVC to set group permissions on the newly created/downloaded cache
files:

```dvc
$ dvc config cache.shared group
```

Commit changes to `.dvc/config` and push them to your git remote:

```dvc
$ git add .dvc/config
$ git commit -m "dvc: shared external cache dir"
```

## Examples

You and your colleagues can work in your own separate <abbr>workspaces</abbr> as
usual, and DVC will handle all your data in the most effective way possible.
Let's say you are cleaning up the data:

```dvc
$ dvc add raw
$ dvc run -d raw -o clean ./cleanup.py raw clean
$ git add raw.dvc clean.dvc
$ git commit -m "cleanup raw data"
$ git push
```

Your colleagues can [checkout](/doc/command-reference/checkout) the project
data, and have both `raw` and `clean` data files appear in their workspace
without moving anything manually. After this, they could decide to continue
building this pipeline and process the cleaned up data:

```dvc
$ git pull
$ dvc checkout
$ dvc run -d clean -o processed ./process.py clean process
$ git add processed.dvc
$ git commit -m "process clean data"
$ git push
```

And now you can just as easily make their work appear in your workspace by:

```dvc
$ git pull
$ dvc checkout
```
