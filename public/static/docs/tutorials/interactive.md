## Basic Concepts

Learn basic concepts and features of DVC with interactive lessons:

1. [Data Management](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/data) <br/> The
   core function of DVC is data tracking and management. Let's see how to do it.

2. [Getting the Best Performance](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/performance)
   <br/> It is important to optimize the DVC setup for having the best
   performance with handling big data files.

3. [Tracking Data Versions](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/versioning)
   <br/> DVC takes advantage of GIT's versioning features to keep track of the
   data versions.

4. [Sharing Data](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/sharing) <br/> DVC
   facilitates sharing of data between different people that work on the same
   project.

5. [Stages And Pipelines](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/pipelines)
   <br/> DVC has a built-in way to connect ML steps into a DAG and run the full
   pipeline end-to-end.

6. [Importing Data](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/importing) <br/>
   Download and track data from the
   [remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote) of any DVC project that is
   hosted on a Git repository.

## Simple ML Scenarios

Learn how DVC can be used in simple ML scenarios:

- [Data Versioning](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/tutorials/versioning) <br/>
  Using DVC commands to work with multiple versions of datasets and ML models.

- [Stages and Pipelines](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/tutorials/pipelines)
  <br/> Using DVC commands to build a simple ML pipeline.

- [Scripting DVC](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/tutorials/scripting) <br/>
  Using bash scripting to build stages and pipelines.

- [MNIST](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/tutorials/mnist) <br/> Creating a
  model to classify images of hand-written digits using MNIST as the data-set.
