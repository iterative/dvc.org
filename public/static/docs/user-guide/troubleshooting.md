## Too many open files error {#many-files}

A known problem some users run into with the `dvc pull`, `dvc fetch` and
`dvc push` commands is `[Errno 24] Too many open files` (most common for S3
remotes on MacOS). The more `--jobs` specified, the more file descriptors need
to be open on the host file system for each download thread, and the limit may
be reached, causing this error.

To solve this, it's often possible to increase the open file descriptors limit,
with `ulimit` on UNIX-like system (for example `ulimit -n 1024`), or
[increasing Handles limit](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/markrussinovich/2009/09/29/pushing-the-limits-of-windows-handles/)
on Windows. Otherwise, please try using a lower `JOBS` value.
