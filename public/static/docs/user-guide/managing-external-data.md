# Managing External Data

There are cases when data is so large, or its processing is organized in a way
that you would like to avoid moving it out of its external/remote location. For
example from a network attached storage (NAS) drive, processing data on HDFS,
running [Dask](https://dask.org/) via SSH, or having a script that streams data
from S3 to process it. A mechanism for external outputs and
[external dependencies](/doc/user-guide/external-dependencies) provides a way
for DVC to control data externally.

## Description

DVC can track files on an external storage with `dvc add` or specify external
files as outputs for [DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) created by
`dvc run` (stage files). External outputs are considered part of the <abbr>DVC
project</abbr>. DVC will track changes in them and reflect this in the output of
`dvc status`.

Currently, the following types (protocols) of external outputs (and cache) are
supported:

- Local files and directories outside of your <abbr>workspace</abbr>
- SSH
- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- HDFS

> Note that these are a subset of the remote storage types supported by
> `dvc remote`.

In order to specify an external output for a stage file, use the usual `-o` or
`-O` options of the `dvc run` command, but with the external path or URL
pointing to the file in question. For <abbr>cached</abbr> external outputs
(`-o`) you will need to
[setup an external cache](/doc/command-reference/config#cache) location.
Non-cached external outputs (`-O`) do not require an external cache to be setup.

> Avoid using the same remote location that you are using for `dvc push`,
> `dvc pull`, `dvc fetch` as external cache for your external outputs, because
> it may cause possible checksum overlaps. Checksum for some data file on an
> external storage can potentially collide with checksum generated locally for a
> different file, with a different content.

## Examples

For the examples, let's take a look at a [stage](/doc/command-reference/run)
that simply moves local file to an external location, producing a `data.txt.dvc`
stage file (DVC-file).

> Note that some of these commands use the `/home/shared` directory, typical in
> Linux distributions.

### Local file system path

The default local cache location is `.dvc/cache`, so there is no need to specify
it explicitly.

```dvc
$ dvc add /home/shared/mydata
$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          -o /home/shared/data.txt \
          cp data.txt /home/shared/data.txt
```

### SSH

```dvc
# Add SSH remote to be used as cache location for SSH files
$ dvc remote add sshcache ssh://user@example.com:/cache

# Tell DVC to use the 'sshcache' remote as SSH cache location
$ dvc config cache.ssh sshcache

# Add data on SSH directly
$ dvc add ssh://user@example.com:/mydata

# Create the stage with external SSH output
$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          -o ssh://user@example.com:/home/shared/data.txt \
          scp data.txt user@example.com:/home/shared/data.txt
```

### Amazon S3

```dvc
# Add S3 remote to be used as cache location for S3 files
$ dvc remote add s3cache s3://mybucket/cache

# Tell DVC to use the 's3cache' remote as S3 cache location
$ dvc config cache.s3 s3cache

# Add data on S3 directly
$ dvc add s3://mybucket/mydata

# Create the stage with external S3 output
$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          -o s3://mybucket/data.txt \
          aws s3 cp data.txt s3://mybucket/data.txt
```

### Google Cloud Storage

```dvc
# Add GS remote to be used as cache location for GS files
$ dvc remote add gscache gs://mybucket/cache

# Tell DVC to use the 'gscache' remote as GS cache location
$ dvc config cache.gs gscache

# Add data on GS directly
$ dvc add gs://mybucket/mydata

# Create the stage with external GS output
$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          -o gs://mybucket/data.txt \
          gsutil cp data.txt gs://mybucket/data.txt
```

### HDFS

```dvc
# Add HDFS remote to be used as cache location for HDFS files
$ dvc remote add hdfscache hdfs://user@example.com/cache

# Tell DVC to use the 'hdfscache' remote as HDFS cache location
$ dvc config cache.hdfs hdfscache

# Add data on HDFS directly
$ dvc add hdfs://user@example.com/mydata

# Create the stage with external HDFS output
$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          -o hdfs://user@example.com/home/shared/data.txt \
          hdfs fs -copyFromLocal \
                            data.txt \
                            hdfs://user@example.com/home/shared/data.txt
```

Note that as long as there is a `hdfs://...` path for your data, DVC can handle
it. So systems like Hadoop, Hive, and HBase are supported!
