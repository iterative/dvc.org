# External Dependencies

There are cases when data is so large, or its processing is organized in a way
that you would like to avoid moving it out of its external/remote location. For
example from a network attached storage (NAS) drive, processing data on HDFS,
running [Dask](https://dask.org/) via SSH, or having a script that streams data
from S3 to process it. A mechanism for external dependencies and
[external outputs](/doc/user-guide/managing-external-data) provides a way for
DVC to control data externally.

## Description

With DVC, you can specify external files as dependencies for your pipeline
stages. DVC will track changes in them and reflect this in the output of
`dvc status`.

Currently, the following types (protocols) of external dependencies are
supported:

- Local files and directories outside of your <abbr>workspace</abbr>
- SSH
- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- HDFS
- HTTP

> Note that these are a subset of the remote storage types supported by
> `dvc remote`.

In order to specify an external dependency for your stage, use the usual '-d'
option in `dvc run` with the external path or URL pointing to your desired file
or directory.

## Examples

As examples, let's take a look at a [stage](/doc/command-reference/run) that
simply moves local file from an external location, producing a `data.txt.dvc`
stage file (DVC-file).

> Note that some of these commands use the `/home/shared` directory, typical in
> Linux distributions.

### Local file system path

```dvc
$ dvc run -d /home/shared/data.txt \
          -o data.txt \
          cp /home/shared/data.txt data.txt
```

### SSH

```dvc
$ dvc run -d ssh://user@example.com:/home/shared/data.txt \
          -o data.txt \
          scp user@example.com:/home/shared/data.txt data.txt
```

### Amazon S3

```dvc
$ dvc run -d s3://mybucket/data.txt \
          -o data.txt \
          aws s3 cp s3://mybucket/data.txt data.txt
```

### Google Cloud Storage

```dvc
$ dvc run -d gs://mybucket/data.txt \
          -o data.txt \
          gsutil cp gs://mybucket/data.txt data.txt
```

### HDFS

```dvc
$ dvc run -d hdfs://user@example.com/home/shared/data.txt \
          -o data.txt \
           hdfs fs -copyToLocal \
                            hdfs://user@example.com/home/shared/data.txt \
                            data.txt
```

### HTTP

> Including HTTPs

```dvc
$ dvc run -d https://example.com/data.txt \
          -o data.txt \
          wget https://example.com/data.txt -O data.txt
```

## Example: DVC remote aliases

If instead of a URL you'd like to use an alias that can be managed
independently, or if the external dependency location requires access
credentials, you may use `dvc remote add` to define this location as a DVC
Remote, and then use a special URL with format `remote://{remote_name}/{path}`
to define an external dependency.

For example, for an HTTPs remote/dependency:

```dvc
$ dvc remote add example https://example.com
$ dvc run -d remote://example/data.txt \
          -o data.txt \
          wget https://example.com/data.txt -O data.txt
```

Please refer to `dvc remote add` for more details like setting up access
credentials for the different remotes.

## Example: `import-url` command

In the previous examples, special downloading tools were used: `scp`,
`aws s3 cp`, etc. `dvc import-url` simplifies the downloading for all the
supported external path or URL types.

```dvc
$ dvc import-url https://data.dvc.org/get-started/data.xml
Importing 'https://data.dvc.org/get-started/data.xml' -> 'data.xml'
```

The command above creates the <abbr>import stage</abbr> (DVC-file)
`data.xml.dvc`, that uses an external dependency (in this case an HTTPs URL).

```yaml
# ...
deps:
  - etag: '"f432e270cd634c51296ecd2bc2f5e752-5"'
    path: https://data.dvc.org/get-started/data.xml
outs:
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: data.xml
    cache: true
    metric: false
    persist: false
```

DVC checks the headers returned by the server, looking for a strong
[ETag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) or a
[Content-MD5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1864) header, and uses it to
determine whether the source has changed and we need to download the file again.

## Example: Using import

`dvc import` can download a <abbr>data artifact</abbr> from any <abbr>DVC
project</abbr> or Git repository. It also creates an external dependency in its
<abbr>import stage</abbr> (DVC-file).

```dvc
$ dvc import git@github.com:iterative/example-get-started model.pkl
Importing 'model.pkl (git@github.com:iterative/example-get-started)'
-> 'model.pkl'
```

The command above creates `model.pkl.dvc`, where the external dependency is
specified (with the `repo` field).

<details>

### Expand to see resulting DVC-file

```yaml
# ...
deps:
  - path: model.pkl
    repo:
      url: git@github.com:iterative/example-get-started
      rev_lock: 6c73875a5f5b522f90b5afa9ab12585f64327ca7
outs:
  - md5: 3863d0e317dee0a55c4e59d2ec0eef33
    path: model.pkl
    cache: true
    metric: false
    persist: false
```

The `url` and `rev_lock` subfields under `repo` are used to save the origin and
[version](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions) of the dependency, respectively.
