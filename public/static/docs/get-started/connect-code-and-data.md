# Connect Code and Data

Even in its basic scenarios, commands like `dvc add`, `dvc push`, `dvc pull`
described in the previous sections could be used independently and provide a
basic useful framework to track, save and share models and large data files. To
achieve full reproducibility though, we'll have to connect code and
configuration with the data it processes to produce the result.

<details>

### Expand to prepare example code

If you've followed this _Get Started_ section from the beginning, run these
commands to get the example code:

```dvc
$ wget https://code.dvc.org/get-started/code.zip
$ unzip code.zip
$ rm -f code.zip
```

Windows doesn't include the `wget` utility by default, but you can use the
browser to download `code.zip`. (Right-click
[this link](https://code.dvc.org/get-started/code.zip) and select
`Save Link As...` (Chrome). Save it into the project directory.

The workspace should now look like this:

```dvc
$ tree
.
├── data
│   ├── data.xml
│   └── data.xml.dvc
└── src
    ├── evaluate.py
    ├── featurization.py
    ├── prepare.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── train.py
```

Now let's install the requirements. But before we do that, we **strongly**
recommend creating a
[virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments):

```dvc
$ virtualenv -p python3 .env
$ echo ".env/" >> .gitignore
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

Optionally, save the progress with Git:

```dvc
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add source code files to repo"
```

</details>

Having installed the `src/prepare.py` script in your repo, the following command
transforms it into a reproducible [stage](/doc/command-reference/run) for the ML
pipeline we're building (described in the
[next chapter](/doc/tutorials/pipelines)).

```dvc
$ dvc run -f prepare.dvc \
          -d src/prepare.py -d data/data.xml \
          -o data/prepared \
          python src/prepare.py data/data.xml
```

`dvc run` generates the `prepare.dvc` DVC-file. It has the same
[format](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) as the file we created in the
[previous section](/doc/get-started/add-files) to track `data.xml`, except in
this case it has additional information about the `data/prepared` output (a
directory where two files, `train.tsv` and `test.tsv`, will be written to), and
about the Python command that is required to build it.

### Expand to learn more about what has just happened

This is how the result should look like now:

```diff
    .
    ├── data
    │   ├── data.xml
    │   ├── data.xml.dvc
+   │   └── prepared
+   │       ├── test.tsv
+   │       └── train.tsv
+   ├── prepare.dvc
    └── src
        ├── evaluate.py
        ├── featurization.py
        ├── prepare.py
        ├── requirements.txt
        └── train.py
```

This is how `prepare.dvc` looks like:

```yaml
cmd: python src/prepare.py data/data.xml
deps:
  - md5: b4801c88a83f3bf5024c19a942993a48
    path: src/prepare.py
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: data/data.xml
md5: c3a73109be6c186b9d72e714bcedaddb
outs:
  - cache: true
    md5: 6836f797f3924fb46fcfd6b9f6aa6416.dir
    metric: false
    path: data/prepared
wdir: .
```

Let's briefly mention what the options used above mean for this particular
example:

`-f prepare.dvc` specifies a name for the DVC-file (pipeline stage). It's
optional but we recommend using it to make your project structure more readable.

`-d src/prepare.py` and `-d data/data.xml` mean that the `prepare.dvc` stage
file depends on them to produce the result. When you run `dvc repro` next time
(see next chapter) DVC will automatically check these dependencies and decide
whether this stage is up to date or whether it should be executed to regenerate
its outputs.

`-o data/prepared` specifies the output directory processed data will be put
into. The script creates two files in it – that will be used later to generate
features, train and evaluate the model.

And, the last line, `python src/prepare.py data/data.xml`, specifies a command
to run. This command is saved to the generated DVC-file, and used later by
`dvc repro`.

Hopefully, `dvc run` (and `dvc repro`) will become intuitive after a few more
Get Started chapters. You can always refer to the their command references to
learn the specific details about how they behave, and all of their options.

</details>

You don't need to run `dvc add` to track output files (`prepared/train.tsv` and
`prepared/test.tsv`) with DVC. `dvc run` takes care of this. You only need to
run `dvc push` (usually along with `git commit`) to save them to the remote when
you are done.

Let's commit the changes to save the stage we built:

```dvc
$ git add data/.gitignore prepare.dvc
$ git commit -m "Create data preparation stage"
$ dvc push
```
