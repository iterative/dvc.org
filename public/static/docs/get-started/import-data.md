# Import Data

We've seen how to [push](/doc/get-started/store-data) and
[pull](/doc/get-started/retrieve-data) data from/to a <abbr>DVC project</abbr>'s
[remote](/doc/command-reference/remote). But what if we wanted to integrate a
dataset or ML model produced in one project into another one?

One way is to manually download the data (with `wget` or `dvc get`, for example)
and use `dvc add` to track it, but the connection between the projects would be
lost. We wouldn't be able to tell where the data came from or whether there are
new versions available. A better alternative is the `dvc import` command:

<!--
In the [Add Files](/doc/get-started/add-files) chapter, for example, we download
raw data using the `dvc get` command, and then track it with `dvc add`. Let's
replace this previous step with an _import stage_:

```dvc
$ ...
$ dvc import https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry \
             get-started/data.xml -o data/data.xml
```
-->

```dvc
$ dvc import https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry \
             get-started/data.xml
```

This downloads `data.xml` from our
[dataset-registry](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry) project into
the current working directory, adds it to `.gitignore`, and creates the
`data.xml.dvc` [DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) to track changes in
the source data. With _imports_, we can use `dvc update` to bring in changes in
the external data source before [reproducing](/doc/get-started/reproduce) any
<abbr>pipeline</abbr> that depends on this data.

### Expand to learn more about imports

Note that the [dataset-registry](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry)
repository doesn't actually contain a `get-started/data.xml` file. Instead, DVC
inspects
[get-started/data.xml.dvc](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry/blob/master/get-started/data.xml.dvc)
and tries to retrieve the file using the project's default remote (configured
[here](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry/blob/master/.dvc/config)).

DVC-files created by `dvc import` are called _import stages_. They use the
`repo` field in the dependencies section (`deps`) in order to track source data
changes (as an [external dependency](/doc/user-guide/external-dependencies)),
enabling the reusability of data artifacts. For example:

```yaml
md5: fd56a1794c147fea48d408f2bc95a33a
locked: true
deps:
  - path: get-started/data.xml
    repo:
      url: https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry
      rev_lock: 7476a858f6200864b5755863c729bff41d0fb045
outs:
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: data.xml
    cache: true
    metric: false
    persist: false
```

The `url` and `rev_lock` subfields under `repo` are used to save the origin and
[version](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions) of the dependency, respectively.

> Note that `dvc update` updates the `rev_lock` field of the corresponding
> DVC-file (when there are changes to bring in).

Since this is not an official part of this _Get Started_, bring everything back
to normal with:

```dvc
$ git reset --hard
$ rm -f data.*
```

> See also `dvc import-url`.
