# Agenda

In the next few sections we'll build a simple natural language processing (NLP)
project from scratch. If you'd like to get the final result or have any issues
along the way, you can download the fully reproducible
[GitHub project](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started) by running:

```dvc
$ git clone https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started
```

Otherwise, bear with us and we'll introduce some basic DVC concepts to get the
same results together!

The idea for this project is a simplified version of our
[Deep Dive Tutorial](/doc/tutorials/deep). It explores the NLP problem of
predicting tags for a given StackOverflow question. For example, we might want a
classifier that can classify (or predict) posts about Python by tagging them
with `python`.

This is a natural language processing context, but NLP isn't the only area of
data science where DVC can help. DVC is designed to be agnostic of frameworks,
languages, etc. If you have data files or datasets and/or you produce data
files, models, or datasets and you want to:

- Capture and save those <abbr>data artifacts</abbr> the same way you capture
  code
- Track and switch between different versions of data easily
- Understand how data artifacts (e.g. ML models) were built in the first place
- Be able to compare models to each other
- Bring software best practices to your team and get everyone on the same page
