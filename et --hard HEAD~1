    Re-add abbrs within details (#1359)
    
    * cmd ref: update WebDAV remote info
    per https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/1187#issuecomment-619568544
    
    * cmd ref: remove WebDAV remote info

    * glossary: add back DVC project
    per https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/1334#pullrequestreview-417880802
    
    * Re-add abbrs within details
    
    This feature broke at some point in the past and all these were removed. The
    feature has since been fixed, so these are safe to re-add.
    
    * Re-add cache directory in add-files
    
    * Change "cache directory" to "cache"
    
    We don't have a tooltip match for "cache directory"
    
    * Re-add some missed abbrs
    
    * Revert grammar change
    
    I think I missed the correct context originally when editing it, and committed
    it because it looked like any other abbr addition.

    Build time tooltips (#1334)
    
    * Add sourceNodes to the Gatsby APIs called by Models
    
    * Change glossary to ES5
    
    This lets it be used at build time without transpilation.
    
    We could also use JSON, but this change is smaller and easier.
    
    * Remove react-markdown and replace it with build-time HTML
    
    This is similar to the recent Community refactor. A model parses the raw JS
    glossary data, walks the tree parsing all Markdown to HTML, then exposes the
    resulting processed glossary via GraphQL and a useStaticQuery hook.
    
    The `Tooltip` components that used to use `react-markdown` now use
    `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to consume description data.
    
    * Add Types for Glossary hook
    
    * Explicitly add remark-rehype
    
    * Fix glossary entry for DVC cache
    
    Remark dislikes special elements broken across lines halfway, so this is needed
    to get the link processsed.
    
    * Convert Glossary to YAML data file
    
    YAML is much friendlier than JSON for embedded multiline string content, and
    with a slight modification to the JSON file loader we can handle them the exact
    same way and parse the YAML to JSON at build time to serve to the components.
    
    With a regular data file instead of a JS module, HMR works for tooltips
    now (mostly)!
    We used to have to restart the dev server to update tooltips, and the previous
    iteration of this branch also had caching issues. This solves that by binding
    the Glossary data to a file, piggybacking on its `contentDigest`.
    
    You still have to refresh the page to update tooltips though, but I think this
    is more due to how they are implemented with state on the client side. Either
    way, it's an improvement from before and eliminating the need to restart gets us
    most of the possible time savings in this regard.
    
    - Added YAML support to `json-files` model. I didn't rename it because I think
      `json-files` more accurately describes how files are parsed into plain JSON
      than something like `data-files`
    
    - Updated Glossary model to use YAML source file
    
    - Converted ES5 glossary to YAML
    
    - Explicitly add `js-yaml` and run `yarn update`
      `js-yaml` is used within Gatsby, so it's already installed.
      However, we get two different versions without an `update`
    
    * Fix link line break in glossary yml
    
    Remark doesn't like breaking specifically between `]` and `(` in a link, but
    this should be fine.
    
    * Fix Community model
    
    * Change Glossary to be sourced from Markdown files.
    
    This lays the groundwork to transform them into a more elaborated-upon
    construct called "Basic Concepts"- basically, the glossary is going to have
    extra data for users who aren't satisfied with a tooltip.
    
    For now, this just sets the data structure and fixes the original issue of
    build-time tooltip contents. The rest will be handled in a couple other
    individual issues.
    
    This commit removes the explicit addition of `js-yaml` since we don't need to
    use it in our code. It's still around as a dependency of other packages.
    
    * Remove dead code caught by linter
    
    * Revert more JSON+YAML data file logic to JSON only
    
    * Change from double to single quotes in basic concepts
    
    * Remove remark-rehype
    
    We no longer use it anywhere.
    
    * Re-use childNodeCreator in the other Models.
    
    This simple wrapper was introduced in the Community Model. I'm just using it in
    the other models now where applicable.
    
    `childNodeCreator` makes a function that acts like `createNode`, but adds in the
    parent ID of the current node calls `createParentChildLink` between the two
    nodes, and resolves when the prior two tasks do.
    
    I invoke the creators in the "parent" models' APIs so the Models that consume
    them get a nice function for creating child nodes. The consumer API calls that
    use this helper don't even need to destructure `actions` anymore, as making a
    child node is their only function most of the time.
    
    * Replace single-quotes with backticks (code quotes)
    
    * Empty commit to test automatic deploys

    Add cards to the home page (#1268)
    
    * Add templates to doc pages and give docs home one
    
    - Default docs page template moved from `src/templates/doc-home.tsx` to
      `src/templates/doc.tsx`. A new homepage-specific (but currently identical)
      template has been added in its place.
    
    - Added frontmatter to docs home source to define the template
    
    - Docs now have a "template" field, which when defined changes the component
      used to make its page. This is a file relative to `src/templates` with the
      extension left off. This defaults to `doc`, or the file
      `src/templates/doc.tsx`. This is not currently on blog posts.
    
    * Add "card" and "cards" custom components to Docs
    
    * Create some example content with the new custom card components
    
    This is not intended to be final, but show off the general premise of
    how using custom components for this kind of layout would look like.
    
    The card and cards components are, on top of being fully stylable with CSS
    modules, capable of using arbitrary Markdown images or elements as the card
    "logo" when the `logo` prop is set to `true` (or anything truthy, like the
    string `"true"`). This works around the complexity of working in custom image
    capability by leaning on the one we already have in Markdown.
    
    To make a card with a logo, set the "logo" prop to true and make sure the first
    element in the card contains the image you want- this element will be set aside
    in its own div, with the rest of the contents displayed beside it using `flex`
    
    There are some quirks with Remark custom components, though:
    
    - custom components aren't indented
    
    - custom components must be contained to one line, including props.
    
    - custom components can include Markdown, but there must be an empty line
      between the transition.
    
    - self-closing tags aren't supported
    
    Should we use custom components more often, we can migrate to MDX (I actually
    already have a fully working branch with it that I made on my own time) which
    handles this syntax much more comfortably because it's designed around the
    concept. All our custom remark-based logic will cleanly port because MDX
    actually uses Remark in its pipeline.
    
    * Resolve TS issues in example
    
    * Remove doc home template and example images
    
    In an effort to make the current solution good enough to fit release, I've
    removed the alternate template since this branch currently favors custom
    components.
    
    * Add example images to all home cards, and remove example heading.
    
    * Remove images from cards in doc home content
    
    * Improve Cards and add href feature.
    
    Cards now accept a `href` prop, which turns the whole card into a link. This is
    our Link wrapper, so we get the same automatic `rel` and `target` setting for
    external links as well as Gatsby Link for internal ones.
    
    This link spans the whole card, and has some styling to go along with it.
    Currently the hover style is set to a slight grow animation, but it could be
    anything.
    
    Most of the `children`-modifying hackery has been removed in favor of wrapping
    all Cards. This also brings a degree of consistency to Cards, and we can apply
    indivual styles if the need arises. It's still needed for the Card Images,
    however, since newlines that show up in `children` are mandatory for how
    rehype's React and MD are separated.
    
    * Change doc home content
    
    - Make each Card a single link applied via the new `href` part
    
    - Add headings to each card
    
    - Remove card icons
    
    * Change hover animation to background-color
    
    Now they match the right side buttons, aside from the animated transition.
    
    * index: simplify and update content
    
    * Restyled by prettier (#1335)

    * home page, get started - fix the link
    
    * docs index - change oder, cards should go first
    
    * home index: return use cases
    
    * card style: less contrast for the heading
    
    * docs home page: update cards text

    Special bullet/style for sidebar docs home (#1322)
    
    * Properly detect when on docs home
    
    This fixes an unreported issue (well, at least I haven't seen it) where the docs
    sidebar wouldn't mark home as active when the user is on it.
    
    This fix won't work if we decide to add children to the docs home later on, but
    we currently don't, I'm pretty sure we have no plans to, and we can easily adapt
    this fix to handle it if we ever do.
    
    * Fix TS issues
    
    * Fix variable rename typo from ts fix
    
    * Change path to be sourced from Gatsby
    
    Beforehand, we were getting the value from the `location` global. This way, we
    aren't subject to the whims of the browser and will get the canonical path every
    time.
    
    * Give docs home a special bullet
    
    This branch adds the fields "icon" and "style" to the allowed fields in
    sidebar.json.
    
    The "style" field applies a class from the sidebar module to the item.
    Similarly, the "icon" field lets one define a custom icon on a menu item that
    replaces the default `::before` bullet. Usable icons must be added as a
    component (any source works, I used SVGR but an `img` can be used for raster
    images. The class has to exist in the sidebar CSS module to do anything, but
    using one that doesn't exist won't break the build.
    
    Once an icon is defined, it can be used and shared with any amount of sidebar
    entries anywhere by using its key in the const as the value of "icon". Items
    with `icon` defined will have the default triangle bullet removed.
    
    The home SVG changes color with the link because it's made with `currentColor`
    and an actual element instead of the more limited `::before`.
    
    * Fix TS
    
    * Give leaf items circle bullets by default
    
    * slight adjustment on leaf bullet positioning
    
    * Fix regression where items don't highlight at build time
    
    I sourced from the wrong place in getting the current path earlier.
    
    * Fix TS
    
    * Fix auto-merge issues
    
    * Change styling
    
    - Remove bullets on leaves
    - Remove bold styling on home
    - Change padding to make non-bullet items look a little better
    
    * Switch rotation of default arrow bullets
    
    This would probably be better done by changing the file, so I'll do that
    afterward.
    
    * Rotate default bullet image
    
    Such that the default state doesn't depend on `animation`.
    
    * Change styles
    
    - Re-add leaf bullets, but smaller now
    - Implement suggested movement changes to home icon
    - Lock icon to text gray

    Log expired events (#1295)
    
    * Skip rendering events if none are in the future.
    
    * Add moment.js to dependencies and run yarn upgrade
    
    Gatsby already depends on moment, this just lets us use it in our code. This
    branch uses it to work with expiry dates.
    
    The yarn upgrade just affects yarn.lock, any pinned packages (like the image
    ones we need for caching to work) are left alone.
    
    * Add support for community page expiration dates
    
    The hero and events in `community` now accept an optional `expires` field, which
    stops the item in question from rendering when the site is built past that date.
    
    This is done through a new shared expiration helper and its child function
    `isExpired`, which uses the `moment` library that Gatsby already depends on to
    determine if an arbitrary content object is expired.
    
    Any object with a `date` and/or `expires` key that can be parsed by `moment` is
    usable in `isExpired`. Objects without an `expires` will be treated as if they
    have an `expires` 7 days after their `date`; this is configurable in a constant.
    
    Also, the expiration helper is in ES5 so it can be used on both during the build
    and at runtime.
    
    * Add an expiration date to the current Hero data
    
    * new header
    
    * Create Community/Events and JsonFile models
    
    These enable data previously imported from JSON files to run through
    the Gatsby GraphQL interface, allowing us to do arbitrary transformations
    and queries of this data.
    
    Building on top of these models allows for more complex features to be
    built either on top or in place of the previously imported JSON files.
    
    This is used in expiration dates to do all date parsing and comparisons
    at build time, allowing us to query for non-expired events in whatever order
    we want (including the original source order) in either direction.
    
    The JsonFiles model differs from `gatsby-source-json` by taking the approach of
    simply exposing parsed JSON content to other models to consume instead of
    inferring a node schema. It's particularly useful for our large JSON files, but
    also simpler to adapt to the possibility of us breaking those files up or even
    getting the data from another source. It actually came from one of my personal
    branches where I make the sidebar run on this logic, but that ended up being
    unnecessary without a feature to justify the change. It will likely be reused in
    the sidebar overhaul.
    
    The Community model will handle parsing the community JSON data and reading it
    into GraphQL. This becomes much easier by moving the `data.json` from the
    `Community` component into the `content` folder. I know we value co-location,
    but co-locating this file would mean pointing `gatsby-source-filesystem` at our
    entire source folder. It makes a lot of sense for this to be in `content` as
    well.
    
    This also changes the expiration helpers, splitting the old
    `isExpired({date,expires})` into `getExpirationDate({date,expires})` and
    `isExpired(expires)`. This allows consumers to get the exact expiration date as
    well as be able to use a boolean.
    
    The new expiration helpers also consider `expires=false` to mean the given
    object never expires. These objects will return `false` when given to
    `getExpirationDate` and `isExpired` will immediately return `false` when given
    `false`. Since the result of both helpers are added to the GraphQL node, these
    implementation details may never come up.
    
    * white background header
    
    * skinny header
    
    * Move Community data into GraphQL
    
    This allows for better build-time processing, enabling things like
    build-time querying for non-expired Events and Heroes.
    
    Instead of importing the JSON file directly, Community content data is now
    accessed through a custom React hook that wraps `useStaticQuery` and massages
    the data into a more usable form.
    
    Events and Heroes are given custom node types, and everything else in the
    community json file is carried over in a unique "rest" node that exposes the
    rest of the properties in JSON.
    
    The Hero and Event components on the community page are adapted to the new
    custom nodes, and the other Community components are successfully working
    through the Rest node- they can be truly ported later or left as-is if they
    don't need to change.
    
    * Change Community Hero link to fragment
    
    - url changed to `#subscribe` fragment in `data.json`
    - hard-coded `target="_blank"` removed from component
    - `scroll-behavior: smooth` added to Page base CSS so Fragment links
      smooth-scroll.
    
    * mobile banner skinny
    
    * Add Hero from the header branch as a non-expiring fallback.
    
    This also includes the fixes to `target`. This should be handled in the `Link`
    wrapper, so we don't have to hard-code it in the Hero component.
    
    * remove border on mobile
    
    * no border for real
    
    * update user generated content links
    
    * update ambassador link
    
    * Create, export, and import interfaces to fix TS issues
    
    This outfits the `useCommunityData` hook with TS definitions which allow it to
    pass `yarn ts-lint`. I'm sure they'll have to be changed in the future, but now
    that we have them refactoring will be less of an issue.
    
    * Revert global CSS smooth scrolling
    
    * Change DVC Ambassador link to root-relative _self
    
    * Delete banner-mobile.png
    
    * Delete banner.png
    
    * Delete fowler_icon.ico
    
    * Delete ml-axis-of-change.png
    
    * Delete donuts.png
    
    * Add smooth scrolling to local fragment Hero
    
    * Fix TS issues
    
    * Remove duration option which broke animation
    
    I'm probably just using it wrong.
    
    * Change false string to literal false in community.json
    
    * Improve and fix schema
    
    - Add a GraphQL type definition for Hero entries
    - Make expiration date helpers safer for Gatsby schema,
      as that's the only place they're used.
    
    * move marcel pic
    
    * Integrate smooth scroll into regular link component
    
    Instead of a separate component, the Link component now accepts a
    `scrollOptions` object that passes options to the internal local fragment scroll
    handler.
    
    This means you can provide a `scrollOptions` object to a link to affect its
    scrolling behavior, and this is compatible with links that could be of any type
    as the `scrollOptions` object is only read when the `Link` wrapper detects a
    local fragment.
    
    This commit also removes special `Link` behavior/imports from the `Hero`
    component.
    
    * Rename default banner images to a more generic name
    
    * remove unused import from community model
    
    * Fix unrelated unused imports
    
    These were reported by `yarn ts-lint`, and this commit cleans all warnings from
    the output.
    
    * Fix handling of 0 usable events
    
    - Remove test `expires: false`
    - Make hook return null if there are no events, but a padded 3-length array in
      any other case.
    - Fix oversight where `expires` Moment wasn't being converted to `Date` for
      Gatsby.
    
    * fix TS issues
    
    * Fix link in community JSON data
    
    There was a duplicate link before that was not only wrong, but caused a
    duplicate key issue because we currently use the URL as the key for user blog
    post entries.
    
    * Remove TODO
    
    We don't do this here, whoops!
    
    * Change "Women in San Diego" event date
    
    * Display a message in a situation with no events.
    
    * Simplify getExpirationDate
    
    * Explicitly define sourceIndex on Hero items
    
    * Change events placeholder to use a common "gray text" class
    
    I couldn't quickly find any existing class to compose over, so I made one in the
    main Community module.
    
    * Write tests for Expiration helpers
    
    * Fix a typo in Event css
    
    * Change shared gray text class to be named "gray"
    
    This avoids a css lint issue, and arguably makes more sense.
    
    * Add logs to indicate when Events are expired
    
    - Add onPostBuild to Models API (alongside pruneCache, which isn't a model)
    - Make Community onPostBuild log expired Events
    
    * Refactor expiration schema
    
    - Move field definitions for `expires` and `expired` to a shared object
    
    - Add the `dateformat` extension to that object, explicitly adding date
      formatting fields
    
    - Remove unnecessary return at the end of expiration logs
    
    * Log expired Heroes and improve expiration logs in general
    
    I've now generalized the expired item log functionality, so expired Heroes are
    now logged as well with the same logic.
    
    Also, all expiration logs (at least for now) are grouped up into one
    `console.warn` that only fires when an event is expired, doing nothing if all
    are fresh.

    Add external doc sidebar links and replace "Changelog" with one. (#1273)
    
    * Add external doc sidebar links and replace "Changelog" with one.
    
    Keep in mind that this is meant as a quick fix, and the current sidebar system
    is likely to be overhauled in the future in a way that will have the
    functionality, but not necessarily invoked with the same "type" syntax.
    
    This branch allows the sidebar to have external links, and changes the
    "Changelog" link at the end to be a link to the DVC GitHub.
    
    Both the sidebar utils and component had to be changed to enable this- the
    sidebar utils moreso as the "external" type bypasses previous logic entirely.
    Anything without "external" set on it is treated the same, however.
    
    The component change just treats external-typed entries a little differently by
    setting `target=_blank` and preventing the `href` from having anything prepended
    to it. The best solution is to move this out of the component level entirely,
    but the best solution isn't the quickest and I've already mentioned big sidebar
    changes are coming soon.
    
    * Remove `target: null` from non-external links.
    
    My mistake, I thought `null` was the proper syntax here and I guess the linter
    missed it.
    
    * Change existing changelog link on Community to point to releases
    
    * Change sidebar link to releases page
    
    * Change external link component choice to an if statement.
    
    This is easier to read for most people, and also works better with linters.
    
    * Make sidebar "type" type field optional
    
    * Add an external link icon ID to the changelog sidebar item
    
    I just grabbed an SVG we already had. It could use some work, but this is a
    simple working implementation so it's worth pushing.
    
    * Use SVGR for sidebar external icon
    
    * Let findChildWithSource accept external links
    
    Some parts of the application still use the sidebar.json helpers to determine
    their links, and when attempting to do so on external-type links broke the
    build.
    
    This change fixes that situation, letting the `findChildWithSource` function
    adapt to input that isn't internal.
    
    It's a bit ugly, but this whole branch is a bit ugly. The sidebar overhaul
    should take care of this more cleanly in the future.
    
    * Remove old changelog pages
    
    I'm sorry, they look like they took some effort to write! But that's also the
    reason we have to stop writing these and get rid of the old ones.
    
    * Change sidebar external icon link to match font color.
    
    I made a new SVG based off the other one. It uses "currentColor" so it will take
    on the color of its surrounding font by default, and also is fully transparent.
    
    This new SVG is only used in the sidebar- other external link icons are still
    the old hard-coded blue and white one.
    
    * Change external link url to be under `url` key
    
    * Add `target="_blank"` on externals by default.
    
    This is done the same way as we already do `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
    The change applies site-wide, but only to external links that don't specify a target.
    
    `target` can still be overridden with anything, including a blank string.
    
    * Fix tests for new temporary sidebar logic
    
    * Move new icon to same dir as sidebar menu component

    Change how relative fragments are handled. (#1260)
    
    - Page-relative fragments (specifically, where the whole href starts with '#')
      are now demoted to plain `a` links in our link wrapper.
    
    - The previous behavior that prepended to these links is now removed.
    
    - The link wrapper `a` fallback has been expanded upon with comments, and now
      sets rel specifically on external links that don't already have it.

    Fix images in the RSS feed (#1245)
    
    * Make root-relative links absolute in feed.
    
    This runs the feed's htmlAst (from the remark transformer) through a processor
    that changes all root-relative links (/example) into absolute
    links (https://dvc.org/example), which is what many non-browser consumers of
    HTML expect.
    
    * Finish getting things working with both processors.
    
    This commit combines the root-relative rewriting with now-working image
    unwrapping to deliver working images to the RSS feed!
    
    The processor definition is also moved into the feed scope to take advantage of
    the feed query to get the root URL.
    
    * Move the feed plugin back to its original space.
    
    Since moving it out of gatsby-config won't be as simple as I thought, I decided
    to leave it out of the scope of this branch.
    
    * Extract feed processor from gatsby-config to its own file
    
    Also changed a bit around implementation:
    
    1. Replaced `rehype-urls`, which depended on older rehype libs, with a local
       implementation of the same thing for root-to-absolute linking.
    
    2. The new feed util leans on the existing rehype-to-html function, and now the

    Fix and improve cache pruning (#1209)
    
    I had some testing behavior in the cache file that logged file removals without
    actually doing them. This would be fine if I had marked it in a TODO or any
    comment whatsoever.
    
    Anyway, this commit fixes that.
    
    I also changed the logic to use regular `fs` and `Promise.new` instead of
    `fs.promises` to avoid the experimental warning. `upath` is used because
    I believe that without it cache pruning won't work on Windows.

    Explicitly add node_modules to cacheDirectories for Heroku (#1203)
    
    This seems to be a more "full" cache than the default behavior, despite
    the Heroku node buildpack docs stating node_modules is cached by default.

    Rebuilds caching (#1182)
    
    * Store .cache and public fully on S3
    
    * Do not cache public and .cache folders on Heroku
    
    * Clean up outdated page-data on rebuilds
    
    * Get rootDir with process.cwd instead of __dirname
    
    This way the code doesn't depend on the source file's relative directory.
    
    * Parallelize uploadAllToS3, downloadAllFromS3, and clean.
    
    I'm not sure if there's any rate limits in the stack that will cause this to break, but on first blush this looks like a quick and easy improvement.
    
    The cached folders are also now accessed by a shared array that is hard-coded for now. This both makes them easier to work with uniformly and open to sourcing directories from elsewhere in the future.
    
    * Fix a broken path.join
    
    * Remove unreachable return
    
    * Improve grammar in log messages
    
    * Further grammar changes in logging
    
    * Move cache pruning into a gatsby hook and fix prefixes.
    
    I believe the crux of what keeps this PR from working is that `public` and
    `.cache` the folders were being uploaded to `public` and `,cache` the S3
    prefixes when the site is deployed from the root prefix. This change alters how
    the cache directories are stored: now as tuple pairs with the local directory in
    slot 0 and a string that's appended to the base prefix in slot 2. `public` work
    with the root prefix and the `.cache` folder works with the root prefix with
    `-cache` appended to it such that it's another "folder" that doesn't get
    downloaded with the root prefix.
    
    I find the tuple syntax more concise, but I'm open to changing it if we prefer
    objects for better grokking at a glance.
    
    This change also moves the responsibility of cache culling into an `onPostBuild`
    Gatsby hook. This means we don't have to parse the sitemap XML after the fact,
    and as such the XML parser used to do it is removed. Since this replaces
    `cleanUpPageData`, it also invalidates the whole `page-data-utils` file which
    has been removed.
    
    * Remove left over console.log statement
    
    * Refactor S3 calls from deploy-with-s3 to s3-utils
    
    * Re-add functionality for moving index.html to project root.
    
    * Add a clarifying comment on the 404 HTML file moving.
    
    * Initialize dotenv in the deploy script and check it to determine if we want to clean local cache post-build.
    
    * Check cwd specifically for heroku
    
    * List the public images cache for heroku
    
    * Make down/uploads synchronous again
    
    * Limit page builds
    
    * Fix re-syncifying downloads/uploads
    
    * Add root-level 404.html to gitignore
    
    * Fix prune-cache to work post-Models
    
    It was firing falsely because some pages still have slashes.
    This commit makes the path set that cache is run against remove all
    trailing slashes, matching the outputof crawlPageData.
    
    * Start logging
    
    * Improve cache dir debug tools
    
    * Consolidate deploy options into one env var.
    
    The only deploy options env var is DEPLOY_OPTIONS, and it takes a
    comma-separated string of build steps to run on the deploy.
    
    A setting of all possible steps would be:
    DEPLOY_OPTIONS="download,logTrees,logHashes,bailAfterLogs,build,upload,clean"
    
    Having DEPLOY_OPTIONS unset gives the following default:
    DEPLOY_OPTIONS="download,build,upload,clean"
    
    If DEPLOY_OPTIONS is specified, it will only perform the provided steps. The
    default options are disregarded.
    
    logHashes makes a small console log of a hash describing the structure of the
    directory trees of `.cache` and `public`. If any file is added, removed, or
    renamed, this hash will change. File content is disregarded, however cache
    busted files with content hashes in their filenames will effectively have
    content-detection behavior.
    
    * Change heroku hook to run on bash and save output
    
    * Make deploy logging script log both to file and console
    
    * Remove NM cache heroku test
    
    * log pages
    
    * log branch env var
    
    * Revert sharp-related gatsby plugins to pre-Jobsv2 behavior to help with nonstandard caching
    
    * Remove page logging from build script and re-enable prod cache warming.
    
    * Re-async downloads and uploads
    
    * Fix {} typo in downloadAll function
    
    * Remove branch logging from onPostBuild
    
    * Remove deploy-with-s3.sh and direct call the js variant again.
    
    * Re-add node_modules cacheDirectories entry
    
    I don't know if it's redundant with the buildpack, but I don't think it can hurt.
    
    * Remove temporary deploy logs.
    
    They can be re-added later if needed, possibly in another branch.
    
    * Remove S3 testing utils import
    
    oops!
    
    * Test Heroku cache
    
    * Don't specify cache directories
    
    * Bump CircleCI cache version (?)

    SEO Improvements (#1183)
    
    * add meta tags for SEO
    
    * Add aria-label props to improve SEO
    
    This adds 10+ points to Lighthouse accessibility score.
    
    Lighthouse sources:
    
    https://web.dev/button-name
    https://web.dev/link-name
    
    * Make meta image sources absolute and re-add old sizes
    
    Some external readers and parsers dislike root-relative links,
    so this commit adds the site URL before all of them.
    
    Also, I re-added the meta icons previously removed. I didn't find explicit
    reasons for or against their inclusion, but considering the extra resource usage
    is minimal I'm going to invoke chesterton's fence here and leave it as it was
    before.
    
    * Change SEO image prop from string to fluid image
    
    This is what the TS def and the component itself expects.
    
    * Revert favicons to original state

    doc-engine: introduce models, refactor node build
    
    * Refactor content parsing logic out into "Models"
    
    Models are a way to conceptualize and organize Gatsby API calls for separate
    content types like blog posts and doc pages.
    A Model is an object whose keys match either the Gatsby Node API or custom calls
    defined by other Models. At its core, a Model is a very barebones Gatsby plugin
    that can respond to events from other Models.
    
    Models are intended to be a little easier then Gatsby plugins to work with
    within a single repo, and they work so similarly to plugins that breaking them
    out down the line is no problem.
    
    Change list:
    - Swap gatsby-node API calls out for Model-based ones where applicable
      - onCreateNode and createPages are changed
      - createSchemaCustomization is added
    - Adapt Blog templates, fragments, and queries to new data shape
      - Most, if not all queries involving the markdown files are changed to go through the new custom nodes.
      - Custom nodes' fields are identical to the remark ones for the most part, other than the new node types and frontmatter/fields being hoisted up to the custom node's root.
      - Resolver-based Remark fields (html/Ast, timeToRead) are accessed by using a fragment on the node's parent.
    - Change various uses of "edges" to "nodes"
    - Convert src/gatsby page builders for posts and docs into Models
    - Move page path generation logic into Models and remove the original function
    - Define model list and imports in src/gatsby/models
    - Make MarkdownContent Model that bootstraps other Markdown-based Models
    - Merge IBlogPostFrontmatter into IBlogPostData
    - Access nodes in page queries by id instead of slug
    - Only generate one blog post in dev mode to cut down on image regeneration. (full site can still be built with `gatsby build`)
    - Change the feed plugin's query and serialization to use BlogPost nodes
    
    * Improve model schema
    
    - Added "gatsby-plugin-parent-resolvers", used functional-style and not imported to config. It's a pretty simple plugin, and can be replicated in the repo if need be.
    
    - Added resolver builder utils to help with making custom resolvers across similar node types.
    
    - `createSchemaCustomization` is now implemented on Authors, BlogPosts and DocsPages
    
    - MD-based custom nodes and ImageSharp nodes are now "id"ed with their relative path.
    
      - This is used extensively for the new node relations (I believe it's more performant than fetching the real ID or hopping through a few relations every time)
    
      - ImageSharps simply have this added through a Model that uses `createNodeField`
    
    - Custom node fields that used to depend on parent fragments now have built-in root level resolvers on their custom nodes. (html, htmlAst, timeToRead on Markdown-based nodes)
    
    - Markdown files that link to other files in their frontmatter now resolve to custom nodes. (blog post -> author)
    
    - BlogPost picture and Author avatar now link directly to ImageSharp nodes.
    
    - Adapted templates, interfaces, and queries to new data shape.
      Basically, anything that used to be in `parent`, `childMarkdownRemark`, or `childImageSharp` is now bumped up to root.
    
    - Some uses of Promise.all are made in the blog model in an attempt to better parallelize the page building process (These can be removed if need be)
    
    * Add a "posts" field to Authors
    
    By default, this field returns an object with all posts the author
    has made sorted by date descending as well as a totalCount.
    
    The field can also be supplied a "limit" argument to limit the amount
    of posts returned. This does not affect totalCount.
    
    * Fix lint problems after merging with the web ui.
    
    * Remove accidental comment paste into gatsby-config
    
    * Remove the rest of the accidentally pasted link
    
    * Re-introduce frontmatter markdown parsing for BlogPost descriptions and picture comments.
    
    * Fix a require that inconsistently lacked an extension.
    
    * Clean up docs/onCreateNode
    
    - Move the "special exemption" comment to where it's more appropriate.
    - Rename pagePath to slug to keep with this project's conventions.
    
    * Change the Model API builder into a simple reusable wrapper.
    
    This is before places that use the builder are updated, so this commit doesn't work.
    
    * Update models/markdown-content/index
    
    - Re-do docs/comments in a more understandable fashion.
    - Adapt to the new API runner and omit pluginOptions in the custom API.
    -
    
    * Fix a misnamed arg in asyncCallOnAll
    
    * Simplify Model API internals and improve comments
    
    Since the functional Gatsby hook builder was received poorly, I flattened out
    the signature of `buildModelApi` and turned it into `runOnModels`, an async
    function with only one layer of signature and, by virtue of being async, can be
    cleanly used in `gatsby-node`.
    
    - Remove the options parameter from Model signatures, since we don't use it currently.
      This was to match Gatsby's `(api, options)` signature and this change makes Models
      deviate from plugins slightly more, but re-adding it in the case of making a Model
      into a Plugin would be nearly effortless so the change was made for aesthetics.
    
    - `onCreateMarkdownContentNode` hooks are now named after the custom hook
      instead of `onCreateNode`.
    
    - Completely rewrote docs for Model runner
    
    * Make blog page limiter work on an env variable
    
    - Initialize dotenv in `gatsby-node` to ensure it's loaded for all models.
    
    - Make the Blog Page limiter in the blog/createPages module trigger only
      when LIMIT_BLOG_PAGES is truthy.
    
    * Capitalize "Model" in markdown content doc comment
    
    * Remove unnecessary index ternary from blog slug.
    
    * Remove unnecessary explicit {models} on onCreateNode call
    
    * Rename internal model runner name to match usage convention
    
    * Add custom foreign-key Node resolvers that operate on trimmed frontmatter fields.
    
    The old resolvers were built around the MD content not changing, but given the
    greenlight to change the Markdown, these new resolvers can both simplify the
    resolver implementation logic as well as make linking images nicer for editors.
    
    For editors:
    - author avatar is now relative to "static/uploads/avatars"
    - authors no longer have the "path" frontmatter field
    - blog post picture is now relative to "static/uploads/images"
    - blog post author is now relative to "content/authors" and doesn't use an extension.
    
    Author frontmatters go from this:
    ```
    ---
    path: ../authors/dmitry_petrov.md
    name: Dmitry Petrov
    avatar: ../../static/uploads/avatars/dmitry_petrov.png
    ---
    ```
    to:
    ```
    ---
    name: Dmitry Petrov
    avatar: dmitry_petrov.png
    ---
    ```
    
    And for blog frontmatters, this:
    ```
    author: ../authors/marija_ilic.md
    picture: ../../static/uploads/images/2017-07-24/post-image.png
    ```
    to this:
    ```
    author: marija_ilic
    picture: 2017-07-24/post-image.png
    ```
    
    Beyond the immediate implications, these custom resolvers allow us to change how
    these fields are resolved behind the scenes to adapt to any future circumstances
    like content relocation.
    
    * Change all existing content frontmatter to work with the new resolvers.
    
    This commit brought to you by Sed.
    
    * Straight up callOnModels to have the same name everywhere.
    
    I replaced all instances of "runOnModels" and "asyncCallOnAll" to "callOnModels"

    docs: version: update output (#1098)
    
    `dvc version` output was adjusted for urgent debugging purposes and I didn't
    send a doc update because it is terribly ugly right now anyway. Instead, I've
    created https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/3499 to tackle that, but
    @shcheklein reasonably requested a temporary doc update just for the
    sake of it, so here we go.

    Add service account information for GCloud (#1030)
    
    * Add service account information for GCloud
    
    This commit adds some additional instructions to successfully set up a service account and configure a DVC command line remote that is pointing to a GCS bucket to use said service account.
    
    Its unclear to me if the remote setup needs the separate `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env call - but it worked here.

    Fix for 'update' of null error in Sentry (#1017)
    
    * Fix for 'update' of null error in Sentry
    
    We were trying to update Perfect Scrollbar after 400ms timeout. If the was user already left the page it caused an error. Now we only update it if the ref to perfect scrollbar is sill present on page after timeout.
    
    See:
    
    https://sentry.io/organizations/iterative/issues/1529236771/
    https://sentry.io/organizations/iterative/issues/1525523962/
    
    And others like that.

    Fix ie11 fill (#1018)
    
    * Fix for 'update' of null error in Sentry
    
    We were trying to update Perfect Scrollbar after 400ms timeout. If the was user already left the page it caused an error. Now we only update it if the ref to perfect scrollbar is sill present on page after timeout.
    
    See:
    
    https://sentry.io/organizations/iterative/issues/1529236771/
    https://sentry.io/organizations/iterative/issues/1525523962/
    
    And others like that.
    
    * Replace Array.fill with lodash to support IE11
    
    Another Sentry error https://sentry.io/organizations/iterative/issues/1521458935/

    Docs about extended S3 remote support for custom ACL
    
    Besides AWS boto3 extra_arg `ACL` (`x-amz-acl` header), there four more
    that could be used to grant specific permissions to specific grantees on
    the uploaded object.
    These headers are:
      - `x-amz-grant-full-control` with boto3's extra_arg `GrantFullControl`
      - `x-amz-grant-read` with boto3's extra_arg `GrantRead`
      - `x-amz-grant-read-acp` with boto3's extra_arg `GrantReadACP`
      - `x-amz-grant-write-acp` with boto3's extra_arg `GrantWriteACP`
    
    As `ACL` (`x-amz-acl` header) is limited to be used with predefined canned ACLs,
    adding support for the aformentioned headers will help in applying
    more customized persmissions solutions according to different project
    needs.

    GitHub Issue #266. From Google - their search engine can independently assign a title for the site, for example, if the title in the <title> tag does not match the page content. Given that the string "DVC" in search results is uppercase, Google took it from the 'alt' attribute of the logo in footer. After the changes on the site, you need to make a request for re-indexing, the instruction is here https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6065812/?hl=ru, the indexing tool itself is https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome, http://joxi.ru/gmv4VBOtqnyN5A. Because of the difference in time zones, I don’t know when the next PR will be accepted for merging, so I didn’t request indexing myself, this requires making changes to the site without leaving the search-console page.
