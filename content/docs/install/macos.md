# Installation on MacOS

> To use DVC [as a Python library](/doc/api-reference), please
> [install with pip](#install-with-pip) or [with conda](#install-with-conda).

## Install with brew

Recommended. Requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```dvc
$ brew install dvc
```

## Install from package

Get the PKG (binary) from the big "Download" button on the [home page](/), or
from the [release page](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/releases/) on GitHub.

> Note that currently, in order to open the PKG file, you must go to the
> Downloads directory in Finder and use
> [secondary click](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207700) on it, then select
> "Open With" > **Installer.app**, and choose the **Open** button.

<!-- Separate MD quote: -->

> You may try [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42120328/761963)
> to uninstall the MacOS package.

## Install with pip

> We **strongly** recommend creating a
> [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments)
> or using
> [pipx](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-stand-alone-command-line-tools/)
> (on Python 3.6+) to encapsulate your local environment.

```dvc
$ pip install dvc
```

Depending on the type of the [remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote) you
plan to use, you might need to install optional dependencies: `[s3]`, `[azure]`,
`[gdrive]`, `[gs]`, `[oss]`, `[ssh]`. Use `[all]` to include them all.

### Example: How to install DVC with support for Amazon S3 storage

```dvc
$ pip install 'dvc[s3]'
```

In this case it installs `boto3` library as well, besides DVC.

## Install with conda

> Requires [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or
> [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/).

```dvc
$ conda install -c conda-forge dvc
```

> Currently, it supports Python 3.5-3.7
