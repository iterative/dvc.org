## Install as a Python library

DVC can be used as a Python library, simply install it with a package manager
like `pip` or `conda`, and as a Python
[project requirement](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files)
if needed. The Python API module is `dvc.api`.

## Advanced options

- You can [install a stable pre-release](/doc/install/pre-release) of DVC to
  stay ahead of official releases.

- Shell completion is automatically enabled by certain installation methods. If
  it does not work for you, please see
  [these instructions](/doc/install/completion) to set it up.

- Please also check out these 3rd-party tool [plugins](/doc/install/plugins),
  which might be useful.
