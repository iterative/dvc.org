# Installation

<admon>

DVC does not replace or include Git. You must have `git` in your system to
enable important features such as [data versioning] and [quick experimentation]
(recommended).

[data versioning]: /use-cases/versioning-data-and-models
[quick experimentation]: /user-guide/experiment-management

</admon>

- [Install on macOS](/install/macos)
- [Install on Windows](/install/windows)
- [Install on Linux](/install/linux)

To check whether DVC is installed or which version you have, use `dvc version`.

<admon type="tip">

Please be sure to read [Upgrading from DVC 2.x to 3.0](/user-guide/upgrade) when
upgrading to DVC 3.0 from an older release.

</admon>

## Advanced options

- You can [install a stable pre-release](/install/pre-release) of DVC to stay
  ahead of official releases.

- Shell completion is automatically enabled by certain installation methods. If
  it does not work for you, see [these instructions](/install/completion) to set
  it up.

- Additionally, you might find these 3rd-party tool
  [plugins](/install/ide-plugins) useful.
