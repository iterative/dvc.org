# Installation

<admon>

DVC does not replace or include Git. You must have `git` in your system to
enable important features such as [data versioning] and [quick experimentation]
(recommended).

[data versioning]: /doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-models
[quick experimentation]: /doc/user-guide/experiment-management

</admon>

- [Install on macOS](/doc/install/macos)
- [Install on Windows](/doc/install/windows)
- [Install on Linux](/doc/install/linux)

To check whether DVC is installed or which version you have, use `dvc version`.

<admon type="tip">

Please be sure to read [Upgrading from DVC 2.x to 3.0](/doc/user-guide/upgrade)
when upgrading to DVC 3.0 from an older release.

</admon>

## Advanced options

- You can [install a stable pre-release](/doc/install/pre-release) of DVC to
  stay ahead of official releases.

- Shell completion is automatically enabled by certain installation methods. If
  it does not work for you, see [these instructions](/doc/install/completion) to
  set it up.

- Additionally, you might find these 3rd-party tool
  [plugins](/doc/install/plugins) useful.
