When you [install](/install) DVC with `pip` or `conda`, it can be used as a
Python library.

This reference provides the details about the functions in the `dvc.api` module,
which can be loaded in any regular way, for example:

```py
import dvc.api
```

The purpose of this API is to provide programmatic access to the data or models
[stored and versioned](/use-cases/versioning-data-and-models) in <abbr>DVC
repositories</abbr> from Python code.
