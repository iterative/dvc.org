# Python API

DVC can be used as a Python library, simply [install](/doc/install) with `pip`
or `conda`. This reference provides the details about the functions in the API
module `dvc.api`, which can be imported any regular way, for example:

```py
import dvc.api
```

The purpose of this API is to provide programmatic access to the data or models
[stored and versioned](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files) in
<abbr>DVC repositories</abbr> from Python code.
