# dvc.api.open()

Opens a tracked file.

```py
def open(path: str,
         repo: str = None,
         rev: str = None,
         remote: str = None,
         mode: str = "r",
         encoding: str = None)
```

#### Usage:

```py
import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open(
        'get-started/data.xml',
        repo='https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry'
        ) as fd:
    # ... fd is a file descriptor that can be processed normally.
```

## Description

Open a data or model file tracked in a <abbr>DVC project</abbr> and generate a
corresponding
[file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object). The
file can be tracked by DVC (as an <abbr>output</abbr>) or by Git.

> The exact type of file object depends on the `mode` used. For more details,
> please refer to Python's
> [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) built-in,
> which is used under the hood.

`dvc.api.open()` may only be used as a
[context manager](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/#context-managers-in-the-standard-library)
(using the `with` keyword, as shown in the examples).

This function makes a direct connection to the
[remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote/add#supported-storage-types)
(except for Google Drive), so the file contents can be streamed. Your code can
process the data [buffer](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html) as it's
streamed, which optimizes memory usage.

> Use `dvc.api.read()` to load the complete file contents in a single function
> call â€“ no _context manager_ involved. Neither function utilizes disc space.

## Parameters

- **`path`** (required) - location and file name of the target to open, relative
  to the root of the project (`repo`).

- `repo` - specifies the location of the DVC project. It can be a URL or a file
  system path. Both HTTP and SSH protocols are supported for online Git repos
  (e.g. `[user@]server:project.git`). _Default_: The current project is used
  (the current working directory tree is walked up to find it).

- `rev` - Git commit (any [revision](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions) such as
  a branch or tag name, or a commit hash). If `repo` is not a Git repo, this
  option is ignored. _Default_: `HEAD`.

- `remote` - name of the [DVC remote](/doc/command-reference/remote) to look for
  the target data. _Default_: The
  [default remote](/doc/command-reference/remote/default) of `repo` is used if a
  `remote` argument is not given. For local projects, the <abbr>cache</abbr> is
  tied before the default remote.

- `mode` - specifies the mode in which the file is opened. Defaults to `"r"`
  (read). Mirrors the namesake parameter in builtin
  [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open).

- `encoding` -
  [codec](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings) used
  to decode the file contents to a string. This should only be used in text
  mode. Defaults to `"utf-8"`. Mirrors the namesake parameter in builtin
  `open()`.

## Exceptions

- `dvc.exceptions.FileMissingError` - file in `path` is missing from `repo`.

- `dvc.exceptions.PathMissingError` - `path` cannot be found in `repo`.

- `dvc.exceptions.NoRemoteError` - no `remote` is found.

## Example: Use data or models from a DVC repository

Any file tracked in a <abbr>DVC project</abbr> (and
[stored remotely](/doc/command-reference/remote/add)) can be processed directly
in your Python code with this API. For example, an XML file tracked in a public
DVC repo on GitHub can be processed like this:

```py
from xml.sax import parse
import dvc.api
from mymodule import mySAXHandler

with dvc.api.open(
        'get-started/data.xml',
        repo='https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry'
        ) as fd:
    parse(fd, mySAXHandler)
```

Notice that we use a [SAX](http://www.saxproject.org/) XML parser here because
`dvc.api.open()` is able to stream the data from remote storage. (The
`mySAXHandler` object should handle the event-driven parsing of the document in
this case.) This increases the performance of the code (minimizing memory
usage), and is typically faster than loading the whole data into memory.

> If you just needed to load the complete file contents into memory, you can use
> `dvc.api.read()` instead:
>
> ```py
> from xml.dom.minidom import parse
> import dvc.api
>
> xmldata = dvc.api.read('get-started/data.xml',
>     repo='https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry')
> xmldom = parse(xmldata)
> ```

## Example: Accessing private repos

This is just a matter of using the right `repo` argument, for example an SSH URL
(requires that the
[credentials are configured](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
locally):

```py
import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open(
        'features.dat',
        repo='git@server.com:path/to/repo.git'
        ) as fd:
    # ... Process 'features'
```

## Example: Use different versions of data

The `rev` argument lets you specify any Git commit to look for an artifact. This
way any previous version, or alternative experiment can be accessed
programmatically. For example, let's say your DVC repo has tagged releases of a
CSV dataset:

```py
import csv
import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open(
        'clean.csv',
        rev='v1.1.0'
        ) as fd:
    reader = csv.reader(fd)
    # ... Process 'clean' data from version 1.1.0
```

Also, notice that we didn't supply a `repo` argument in this example. DVC will
attempt to find a <abbr>DVC project</abbr> to use in the current working
directory tree, and look for the file contents of `clean.csv` in its local
<abbr>cache</abbr>; no download will happen if found. See the
[Parameters](#parameters) section for more info.

## Example: Choose a specific remote as the data source

Sometimes we may want to choose the [remote](/doc/command-reference/remote) data
source, for example if the `repo` has no default remote set. This can be done by
providing a `remote` argument:

```py
import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open(
        'activity.log',
        repo='location/of/dvc/project',
        remote='my-s3-bucket'
        ) as fd:
    for line in fd:
        match = re.search(r'user=(\w+)', line)
        # ... Process users activity log
```

## Example: Specify the text encoding

To chose which codec to open a text file with, send an `encoding` argument:

```py
import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open(
        'data/nlp/words_ru.txt',
        encoding='koi8_r') as fd:
    # ... Process Russian words
```
