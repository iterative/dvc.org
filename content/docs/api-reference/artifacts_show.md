# dvc.api.artifacts_show()

Get the path and Git revision for an <abbr>artifact</abbr> tracked in the
<abbr>model registry</abbr>.

```py
def artifacts_show(
    name: str,
    version: Optional[str] = None,
    stage: Optional[str] = None,
    repo: Optional[str] = None,
) -> Dict[str, str]:
```

<admon type="tip">

If you have a DVC Studio project configured with your [remote storage
credentials], you may also use the DVC Studio [REST API] to programmatically
access artifacts. It does not require the client to have any credentials other
than the DVC Studio [client access token] and does not require DVC to be
installed.

</admon>

## Usage:

```py:
import dvc.api

artifact = dvc.api.artifacts_show(
    'text-classification',
    repo='https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started.git',
)
```

## Description

Returns a path and Git revision for a named artifact which can then be used in
other Python API calls.

The returned dictionary will be of the form:

```py
{
    'path': 'model.pkl',
    'rev': 'c7c6ae0',
}
```

where `path` contains the relative path to the artifact in the DVC repository,
and `rev` contains the Git revision for the specified artifact version or stage.

When neither `version` nor `stage` are provided, the Git revision for the latest
version of the model will be returned.

## Parameters

- `name` (required) - name of the artifact. By default DVC will search for
  artifacts declared in a `dvc.yaml` file located at the root of the DVC
  repository. Artifacts declared in other `dvc.yaml` files should be addressed
  in the form `path/to/dvc.yaml:artifact_name` or `path/to:artifact_name` (where
  `dvc.yaml` is omitted).

- `version` - version of the artifact (mutually exclusive with `stage`).

- `stage` - stage of the artifact (mutually exclusive with `version`).

- `repo` - the location of the DVC project. It can be a URL or a file system
  path. Both HTTP and SSH protocols are supported for online Git repos (e.g.
  `[user@]server:project.git`). _Default_: The current project (found by walking
  up from the current working directory tree).

## Example: Read the contents of an artifact

```py
import pickle
import dvc.api

artifact = dvc.api.artifacts_show(
    'text-classification',
    version='v1.0.0',
    repo='https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started.git',
)
data = dvc.api.read(
    artifact['path'],
    rev=artifact['rev'],
    repo='https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started.git',
    mode='rb',
)
model = pickle.loads(data)
```

This example uses the returned path and Git revision in conjunction with
`dvc.api.read()` to read the file content for the artifact.

## Example: Download an artifact

```py
import os
import dvc.api

artifact = dvc.api.artifacts_show(
    'text-classification',
    stage='prod',
    repo='https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started.git',
)
fs = dvc.api.DVCFileSystem(
    'https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started.git',
    rev=artifact['rev'],
)
fs.get_file(artifact['path'], os.path.basename(artifact['path']))
```

This example uses the returned path and Git revision in conjunction with
`dvc.api.DVCFileSystem` to download the artifact to the current working
directory.
