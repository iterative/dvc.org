# dvc.api.get_url()

Returns the URL to the storage location of a data file or directory tracked in a
<abbr>DVC project</abbr>.

```py
def get_url(path: str,
            repo: str = None,
            rev: str = None,
            remote: str = None) -> str
```

## Usage

```py
import dvc.api

resource_url = dvc.api.get_url(
    'get-started/data.xml',
    repo='https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry'
)
# resource_url is now "https://remote.dvc.org/dataset-registry/a3/04afb96060aad90176268345e10355"
```

## Description

Returns the URL string of the storage location (in a [DVC remote] where a target
file or directory, specified by its `path` in a `repo` (<abbr>DVC
project</abbr>), is stored.

The URL is formed by reading the project's [remote configuration] and the
`dvc.yaml` or `.dvc` file where the given `path` is found (`outs` field). The
schema of the URL returned depends on the [storage type] of the `remote` (see
the [Parameters](#parameters) section).

If the target is a directory, the returned URL will end in `.dir`. Refer to
[Structure of cache directory] and `dvc add` to learn more about how DVC handles
data directories.

<admon type="warn">

This function does not check for the actual existence of the file or directory
in the remote storage.

<admon type="tip">

Having the resource's URL, it should be possible to download it directly with an
appropriate library, such as [`boto3`] or [`paramiko`].

## Parameters

- **`path`** (required) - location and file name of the target, relative to the
  root of the project (`repo`).

- `repo` - specifies the location of the DVC project. It can be a URL or a file
  system path. Both HTTP and SSH protocols are supported for online Git repos
  (e.g. `[user@]server:project.git`). _Default_: The current project (found by
  walking up from the current working directory tree).

- `rev` - Git commit (any [revision](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions) such as
  a branch or tag name, commit hash, or [experiment name]). If `repo` is not a
  Git repo, this option is ignored. _Default_: `None` (current working tree will
  be used)

- `remote` - name of the [DVC remote] to use to form the returned URL string.
  _Default_: The [default remote](/doc/command-reference/remote/default) of
  `repo` is used.

[experiment name]: /doc/command-reference/exp/run#-n

## Exceptions

- `dvc.exceptions.NoRemoteError` - no `remote` is found.

## Example: Getting the URL to a DVC-tracked file

```py
import dvc.api

resource_url = dvc.api.get_url(
    'get-started/data.xml',
    repo='https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry',
)
print(resource_url)
```

The script above prints

`https://remote.dvc.org/dataset-registry/a3/04afb96060aad90176268345e10355`

This URL represents the location where the data is stored, and is built by
reading the corresponding `.dvc` file ([`get-started/data.xml.dvc`]) where the
`md5` file hash is stored,

```yaml
outs:
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: get-started/data.xml
```

and the project configuration ([`.dvc/config`]) where the remote URL is saved:

```ini
['remote "storage"']
url = https://remote.dvc.org/dataset-registry
```

[`.dvc/config`]:
  https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry/blob/master/.dvc/config
[`get-started/data.xml.dvc`]:
  https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry/blob/master/get-started/data.xml.dvc
