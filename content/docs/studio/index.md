# DVC Studio

[DVC Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) is a web application that enables
Machine Learning teams to seamlessly

- [Run and track experiments](/doc/studio/experiments)
- [Manage model lifecycle](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry)
- [Collaborate on Machine Learning projects](/doc/studio/user-guide/team-collaboration)

It works on top of [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
maintaining Git as the single-source-of-truth for your data, experiments and
models.

Sign in to [DVC Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) using your GitHub.com,
GitLab.com, or Bitbucket.org account, or with your email address. Explore the
demo projects and models, and
[let us know](/doc/studio/user-guide/troubleshooting#support) if you need any
help getting started.

## Why DVC Studio?

- Simplify ML experiment tracking, visualization, and collaboration on top of
  Git.
- Keep your code, data and model connected at all times.
- Apply your existing software engineering stack for ML teams.
- Build an ML <abbr>model registry</abbr> for transparency and discovery across
  all your projects.
- Because your model registry is built on top of Git, you can use
  [GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/) for model deployment.
