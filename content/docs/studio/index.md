# Iterative Studio

[Iterative Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) is a web application that
enables Machine Learning teams to seamlessly manage data and models, run and
track experiments, and visualize and share results. It works on top of
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), and works best with [DVC](https://dvc.org/)
repositories.

**Why Iterative Studio?**

- Simplify ML experiment tracking, visualization, and collaboration on top of
  Git.
- Keep your code, data and model connected at all times.
- Apply your existing software engineering stack for ML teams.
- Automate your ML process by transitioning to a no-code interface for running
  experiments on cloud resources of your choice.
- Build an ML model registry for transparency and discovery across all your
  projects.
- Because your model registry is built on top of Git, you can use [GitOps] for
  model deployment.
