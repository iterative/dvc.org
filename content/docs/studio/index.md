# Iterative Studio

[Iterative Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) is a web application that
enables Machine Learning teams to seamlessly

- [Run and track experiments](/doc/studio/experiments)
- [Manage model lifecycle](/doc/studio/model-registry)
- [Collaborate on Machine Learning projects](/doc/studio/user-guide/team-collaboration)

It works on top of [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
maintaining Git as the single-source-of-truth for your data, experiments and
models.

Sign in to [Iterative Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) using your
GitHub.com, GitLab.com, or Bitbucket.org account, or with your email address.
Explore the demo projects and models, and
[let us know](/doc/studio/user-guide/troubleshooting#support) if you need any
help getting started.

## Why Iterative Studio?

- Simplify ML experiment tracking, visualization, and collaboration on top of
  Git.
- Keep your code, data and model connected at all times.
- Apply your existing software engineering stack for ML teams.
- Automate your ML process by transitioning to a no-code interface for running
  experiments on cloud resources of your choice.
- Build an ML model registry for transparency and discovery across all your
  projects.
- Because your model registry is built on top of Git, you can use [GitOps] for
  model deployment.
