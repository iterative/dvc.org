# Iterative Studio

[Iterative Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) is a web application that
enables Machine Learning teams to seamlessly manage data and models, run and
track experiments, and visualize and share results. It works on top of
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), and works best with [DVC](https://dvc.org/)
repositories.

Sign in to [Iterative Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) using your
GitHub.com, GitLab.com, or Bitbucket.org account, or with your email address.
Upon sign-in, the Projects dashboard opens. It includes some demo projects for
you to explore [experiment tracking](/doc/studio/experiments) with DVC Studio.
To explore the [Model Registry](/doc/studio/model-registry), click on the
`Models` tab.

## Why Iterative Studio?

- Simplify ML experiment tracking, visualization, and collaboration on top of
  Git.
- Keep your code, data and model connected at all times.
- Apply your existing software engineering stack for ML teams.
- Automate your ML process by transitioning to a no-code interface for running
  experiments on cloud resources of your choice.
- Build an ML model registry for transparency and discovery across all your
  projects.
- Because your model registry is built on top of Git, you can use [GitOps] for
  model deployment.
