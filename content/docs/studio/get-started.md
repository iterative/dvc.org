# Get Started with Iterative Studio

The following video provides you a quick overview of how to use Iterative
Studio.

> Note that we have renamed DVC Studio to Iterative Studio and Views to
> Projects.

1. Sign in to your [Iterative Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) dashboard
   using your GitHub.com, GitLab.com or Bitbucket.org account, or your email
   address.

   When you sign up, you're on the **Free plan**. To switch to the **Team plan**
   [create a team] first, then go to the [team settings] and click on
   `Change plan` in the `Plan and billing` section.

   To sign up for the **Enterprise plan**, please [schedule a call].

   > See [pricing details] to compare the different plans.

2. If this is the first time you are signing in to Iterative Studio, you will
   see that there already exists a `Demo` project that connects to an example
   DVC repository. Use this project to explore the features that Iterative
   Studio has to offer.

login, an example project is already created for you to explore, and you can add
more projects._

3. Each project on this dashboard displays the metrics that Iterative Studio
   identified in your Git repository. In the figure above, you can see that
   `avg_prec` and `roc_auc` metrics are displayed.

4. To connect to a new repository, click on `Add a Project`. All the
   organizations that you have access to will be listed.

    <admon type="info">

   If you do not see your desired organizations or Git repositories, make sure
   that
   [the connection to your Git server has been set up](/doc/studio/user-guide/account-management#git-integrations).

   To connect to your GitHub repositories, you must install the Iterative Studio
   GitHub app. Refer to the section on
   [GitHub app installation](/doc/studio/user-guide/install-github-app) for more
   details.

   To connect to repositories on your self-hosted GitLab server, you must first
   add a connection to this server and create a team. Refer to the section on
   [self-hosted GitLab server support](/doc/studio/user-guide/install-github-app)
   for more details.

    </admon>

5. Open the organization whose repository you want to connect to. You can also
   use the search bar to directly look for a repository.

6. Specify additional connection settings if required.

   ![](https://static.iterative.ai/img/studio/project_settings.png)

> Project settings must be configured if you are connecting to a non-DVC
> repository, if your metrics are in some custom files, if you are connecting to
> a monorepo, or if your metrics are in cloud or other remote storage. However,
> you can configure the project settings after the project has been created. So
> you can `Skip and Continue` now. Refer to the [Project Settings] section for
> more details.

You should now see that a project has been added in your dashboard.

7. If your project requires any of the additional settings, then remember to
   configure them by opening the [project settings]. Otherwise, your project may
   not work as expected. To go to project settings, click on the
   ![](https://static.iterative.ai/img/studio/view_open_settings_icon.png) icon
   in the project. In the menu that opens up, click on `Settings`.

8. You can also [create multiple projects from a single Git repository].

9. After creating a project, you can use it to [explore the ML experiments] as
   well as [submit new experiments] from Iterative Studio.

10. You can also make the project public by [sharing it on the web].

11. You can [create a team] and invite collaborators. Each team will have its
    own projects dashboard. To create teams with more than 2 team members, [sign
    up for the **Team** plan or **Enterprise** plan].
