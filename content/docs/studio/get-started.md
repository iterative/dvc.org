# Get Started with Iterative Studio

Sign in to your [Iterative Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) dashboard using
your GitHub.com, GitLab.com, or Bitbucket.org account, or with your email
address. Upon sign-in, the Projects dashboard opens. It includes some `Demo`
projects for you to explore.

<admon type="tip">

When you sign up, you're on the **Free plan**. To switch to the **Basic plan**
[create a team] first, then go to the _Team settings_ to [change the plan]. To
sign up for the **Enterprise** plan, please [schedule a call] (see [pricing
details]).

## Run and track experiments

1. Iterative Studio works with Git repositories. So first, [prepare your Git
   repositories] and make sure that
   [the connection to your Git server has been set up](/doc/studio/user-guide/account-management#git-integrations).

[prepare your git repositories]:
  /doc/studio/user-guide/projects-and-experiments/what-is-a-project#prepare-your-repositories

2. Click on `Add a Project` and follow the on-screen instructions to search and
   connect to the desired Git repository. Optionaly pass a sub-directory path
   (or up to 10 comma-separated values) on the settings screen if you use a
   [monorepo] setup.

   <admon type="info">

   Once the project is created, remember to [configure project
   settings][project settings] if [needed][when do you need project settings].

   </admon>

3. Iterative Studio identifies [experiments](/doc/start#experiment-management),
   which are Git commits or Git refs, and parses your project's `dvc.yaml` file
   to identify data, metrics, plots and hyperparameters.

4. Each project on the Projects dashboard displays the metrics of the first
   three columns in your project (such as `avg_prec` and `roc_auc` in the
   following project). You can change which metrics are shown here by reordering
   columns in the project table.

5. Click on the project name to open the project table and [explore all your ML
   experiments][explore ML experiments].

6. You can [train on the cloud and submit new experiments] by changing
   hyperparameters and datasets, and you can run on your own cloud
   infrastructure.

7. To [track live metrics and plots][live-metrics-and-plots] of running
   experiments, set the `STUDIO_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable and use
   [DVCLive] in your training pipeline.

## Manage models

1. Click on the `Models` tab to open the central [Models dashboard]. Iterative
   Studio uses your project's `dvc.yaml` files to identify ML models and
   specially formatted Git tags to identify model versions and stage
   assignments.

   [models dashboard]:
     /doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/view-and-compare-models#models-dashboard

2. Click on the model name to
   [open its details page](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/view-and-compare-models#model-details-page).

3. You can perform the following actions to manage the lifecycle of models:
   - [Add models to the registry](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/add-a-model)
   - [Register new versions of the models](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/register-version)
     (like `v0.0.1` and `v1.0.0`)
   - [Assign stages to model versions](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/assign-stage)
     (e.g. `dev`, `testing`, `prod`)
   - Use models:
     [download them](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/use-models) or
     [set up CI/CD](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/use-models) to publish
     or deploy models

Check out
[`What is a model registry?`](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/what-is-a-model-registry)
to get started.

## Collaborate

1. You can [create a team] and invite collaborators. Each team will have its own
   projects dashboard. To create teams with more than 2 team members, [sign up
   for the **Basic** or **Enterprise** plan].

2. You can also [make your projects public].
