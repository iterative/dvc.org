# Run Experiments

DVC Studio can train your model and run experiments with different
hyperparameters or datasets. Experiments that are created from the terminal or
the VS Code extension can be monitored and managed from DVC Studio. x

## Monitor a running experiment

Once you submit an experiment, a new row is created in the experiments table
under the original Git commit. [Live updates to metrics and plots] generated by
[DVCLive] will show up in this row, and you can click on the experiment name to
view the status and output log of the running experiment task.

## Manage a completed experiment

When the experiment completes, the files (including code, data, models,
parameters, metrics, and plots) are pushed back to your Git and DVC remotes.

In DVC Studio, you can create a branch and pull/merge request from the completed
experiment, so that you can share, review, merge, and reproduce the experiment.
In the pull/merge request, DVC Studio automatically inserts a link to the
training report. So your teammates who are reviewing your PR can quickly and
easily compare your experiment with its baseline.
