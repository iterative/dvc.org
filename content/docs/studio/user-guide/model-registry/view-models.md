# View models

You can find all your models in the [models dashboard](#models-dashboard). Each
model has separate [model details pages](#model-details-page) for all its model
versions. Also, all models from a given Git repository are included as
[`model` columns in the experiment tables](#model-columns-in-the-projects-experiment-table)
of those projects that connect to this Git repository.

## Models dashboard:

The models in your model registry are organized in a central dashboard that
facilitates search and discovery.

You can sort the models in the dashboard by several criteria, including model
framework, repository, etc.

Iterative Studio consolidates the stages of all the models in the registry, and
provides a way to filter models by stages.

Iterative Studio also consolidates the frameworks of all the models in the
registry and provides a way to filter models by framework. Note that the
framework of a model is identified by Iterative’s model deployment tool [MLEM].
If you have not used MLEM, then Iterative Studio will use a generic framework
label (`G`) to indicate that the model framework was not identified, and that
the model was registered using [GTO].

## Model details page:

You can open the details of any model in the registry by clicking on the name of
the model in the models dashboard.

A model details page is divided into the following sections:

- Top section: This contains
  - the model name,
  - a link to the model’s Git repository,
  - latest registered version of the model,
  - a button to
    [register a new version](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/register-version),
    and
  - information about how many projects in Iterative Studio have been created
    from the model’s Git repository.
- Left section: The left section contains information that is specific to a
  particular registered version of the model. It has a version picker, which you
  can use to switch between different registered versions of the model. For the
  selected version, the left section shows
  - a button to
    [assign a stage to the version](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/assign-stage),
  - the path to the model,
  - the version description,
  - labels, and
  - model methods. Note that the methods of a model are identified by
    Iterative’s model deployment tool [MLEM]. If you have not used MLEM, then
    Iterative Studio will not display any methods for the model.
- Right section: The right section contains information that is applicable
  across all the versions of the model. In particular, it displays
  - the assigned stages for the different versions, and
  - the history of all version registration and stage assignment actions.

## Model columns in the project’s experiment table:

The models will also appear as `model` columns in the experiment tables of those
projects that have been created from the Git repository to which the model
belongs.
