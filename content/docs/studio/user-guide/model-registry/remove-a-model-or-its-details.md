# Remove a model, version, or stage assignment

To **remove a model** from the model registry, use the `Deprecate model` menu
item in the 3-dot menu next to the model name in the models dashboard or details
page. This action
[creates a new Git tag in your Git repository to indicate that the model has been deprecated](https://mlem.ai/doc/gto/command-reference/deprecate#deprecating-an-artifact).

You can also remove all of a project's models from Iterative Studio by deleting
the project from your projects dashboard. This does not deprecate the model in
the Git repository.

To **deregister a model version**, use the `Deregister version` menu item in the
3-dot menu next to the model name in the models dashboard or the
`Deregister version` button on the model details page. This action creates a new
Git tag in your Git repository to
[indicate that the given model has been deregistered](https://mlem.ai/doc/gto/command-reference/deprecate#deregister-a-version).

To **unassign a stage from a model version**, use the `Unassign stage` menu item
in the 3-dot menu next to the model name in the models dashboard. You can also
click on the the relevant stage assignment pill in the `Stages` section of the
model details page to reveal the `Unassign stage` menu item. This action creates
a new Git tag in your Git repository to
[indicate that the given model version has been unassigned from the given stage](https://mlem.ai/doc/gto/command-reference/deprecate#unassigning-a-stage).

Removing a Git tag from your Git repository also removes the model version or
stage assignment represented by that Git tag.
