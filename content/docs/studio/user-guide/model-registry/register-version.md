# Version models

You can register new versions of registered models by specifying the Git commit
which corresponds to the new version.

To register a new version of a model, Iterative Studio uses [GTO] to create an
[annotated Git tag][git tag] with the specified version number. Refer the [GTO
docs][gto] to see the exact format of the Git tag.

You can register versions using the [GTO] command line interface (CLI). To
register versions using Iterative Studio, watch this tutorial video or read on
below:

1. On the models dashboard, open the 3-dot menu for the model whose version you
   want to register. Then, click on `Register new version`. The registration
   action can also be initiated from the model details page or from the related
   projectâ€™s experiment table - look for the `Register version` button or icon.

2. Select the Git commit which corresponds to the new version of your model. If
   the desired commit does not appear in the commit picker, type in the
   40-character sha-1 hash of the commit.
3. Enter a version name. Version names must start with the letter `v` and should
   follow the [SemVer] format after the letter `v`. Below are some examples of
   valid and invalid version names:

   - Valid: v0.0.1, v1.0.0, v12.5.7
   - Invalid: 0.0.1 (missing `v` in the beginning), v1.0 (missing the patch
     segment of the [Semver], v1.0.new (using an invalid value `new` as the
     patch number).

4. Optionally, provide a Git tag message.
5. Click on `Register version`.
6. Once the action is successful, the newly registered version will show up in
   the `Latest version` column of the models dashboard. Note that this will
   happen only if the newly registered version is the greatest semantic version
   for your model. For example, if your model already had v3.0.0 registered,
   then if you register a smaller version (e.g., v2.0.0), then the new version
   will not appear in the `Latest version` column.
7. If you open the model details page, the newly registered version will be
   available in the model `History` section as well as in the versions drop
   down.
8. If you go to your Git repository, you will see that a new Git tag referencing
   the selected commit has been created, representing the new version.
