Click on `Confirm` to provide payment and upgrade the plan. You will be

Each collaborator and pending invite takes up a seat in your team. For example,
if you have 5 seats, with 3 collaborators and 2 pending invites, you cannot add
more members until you remove a collaborator or pending invite, or increase the
number of seats.
