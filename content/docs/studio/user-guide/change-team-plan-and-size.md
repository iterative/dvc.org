## Change Team Plan

When you create a team, it is on the Free plan by default. This plan is designed
for teams just starting out with collaboration: you can invite one other team
member and import as many repositories as you want. For more advanced
collaboration functionality, you can upgrade to the Team or Enterprise plans. A
detailed comparison of the different plans can be found in the Iterative Studio
[pricing page](https://studio.iterative.ai/pricing).

To change the plan for your team, go to the `Plan and billing` section within
Team settings. Then, within the `Current plan` card, click on `Change plan`.

A plan comparison page will open. This page provides detailed comparison of the
different plans in Iterative Studio. Your current plan will be marked with a
`Current plan` label.

The total payable amount will be shown. For details of how the payable amount is
calculated, refer to
[billing and payment](/doc/studio/user-guide/billing-and-payment).

To make the payment and upgrade the plan, click on `Confirm`. You will be
redirected to our payment processor, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), for making
the payment. Once your payment is successful, you will be redirected back to the
team settings page in Iterative Studio. Here, you will see that your team is now
in the Team plan.

Each collaborator and pending invite takes up a seat in the team. For example,
if you have 5 seats in your team which has 3 collaborators and 2 pending
invites, you cannot add any more members until you remove a collaborator or
pending invite, or increase the number of seats.

- **To upgrade to the Enterprise plan**, click on the `Contact Us` button and
  you will be redirected to a Calendly form where you can schedule a call with
  our in-house experts who will try to understand your needs and suggest a
  suitable plan and pricing.

### If you are currently on the Team plan

You can downgrade to the Free plan or upgrade to the Enterprise plan.

- **To downgrade to the Free plan**, you must first make sure that your team
  does not have more than 2 collaborators or pending invites. Then, click on the
  `Downgrade` button.

  When you downgrade, you will receive a refund based on the number of days
  remaining in the billing period. If there are any discrepancies in the
  refunded amount, please [contact us](mailto:support@iterative.ai).

- **To upgrade to the Enterprise plan**, click on the `Contact Us` button.

### If you are currently on the Enterprise plan

For any changes to the plan, please contact your focal point at Iterative.

## Change Team Size

You can also change the size of your team within the Team or Enterprise plan at
any point during your subscription.

### If you are currently on the Free plan

To change the number of seats in your team,
[upgrade to the Team or Enterprise plan](#change-team-plan).

### If you are currently on the Team plan

To change the number of seats in your team, go to the `Plan and billing` section
within Team settings. Then, within the `Current plan` card, click on
`Change seats`. Then, select the desired number of seats.

- **If you are increasing the number of seats**, you will have to pay for the
  additional seats. The payable amount is pro-rated based on the number of days
  remaining in the billing period.
- **If you are decreasing the number of seats**, a credit balance will be
  computed based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. This
  credit balance will be used in future payments.

The total payable amount and any changes to your credit balance will be
displayed after you select the number of seats.

To make the payment (or accept the credit balance) and increase/decrease the
number of seats, click on `Confirm`.
