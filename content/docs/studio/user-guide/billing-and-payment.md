# Billing and Payment

Studio is free for individuals and teams with up to 2 members. The Free plan is
designed for teams just starting out with collaboration: you can invite one
other team member and import as many repositories as you want. For more advanced
collaboration functionality, you can sign up for the Team or Enterprise plans.
These are paid plans, and in this section you will learn how to manage billing
and payment for these plans.

## Difference between Free, Team and Enterprise plans

A detailed comparison of the different plans can be found in the Iterative
Studio [pricing page](https://studio.iterative.ai/pricing).

## How to sign up for the Team or Enterprise plan

When you sign up, you're on the Free plan by default. Plans are managed at the
team level. You can
[change the plan](/doc/studio/change-team-plan-or-size#change-team-plan) in a
team's settings page. Each team is on its own plan and needs to be managed
separately.

## How total price is calculated

For Team plans, invoice amount is calculated based on the number of seats in the
team. All invoice amounts are calculated for one billing period at a time. A
billing period is one month long. The price per seat can be found in the
Iterative Studio [pricing page](https://studio.iterative.ai/pricing).

Below is an example calculation:

Suppose you have a team with 5 seats. At a monthly rate of $40 per seat, the
total payable amount for the team = $40 \* 5 = $200 per month.

Increasing or decreasing the number of seats during a billing period will result
in pro-rated amount calculation. See the
[next section](#how-increasing-or-decreasing-the-number-of-seats-affects-total-cost)
for an example.

For Enterprise plans, all invoice amounts are calculated based on the agreement
between you and Iterative.

## How increasing or decreasing the number of seats affects total cost

If you add members to available seats or remove members without reducing the
number of seats in your team, there will be no impact in the cost to you.

If you increase the number of seats, your account will be charged a prorated
amount based on the time remaining in the billing period at the time each seat
was added. For instance, if your billing period runs from the 15th of last month
to the 14th of this month, then, if you add 2 seats on the 10th of this month,
you will be charged for only 5 days for the 2 new seats. In the following
billing period, the 2 additional seats will be taken into account for the entire
billing period.

If you reduce the number of seats, you will accordingly receive an account
credit that you can apply on your next payment.

## Downgrading a plan

At any point during your subscription, you can reduce the number of seats in
your plan.

To cancel the Team plan and move to the Free plan, reduce the number of seats in
the team to 1 or 2 and click on Downgrade. When you reduce the number of seats
in the team, a credit balance will be computed based on the number of days
remaining in the billing period. This credit balance can be used in future
payments.

When you downgrade from the Team plan to the Free plan, you will receive a
refund based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. For any
inquiries about refunds, please [contact us](mailto:support@iterative.ai).

To upgrade to or downgrade from an Enterprise plan, please
[contact us](mailto:support@iterative.ai).

## Billing period, auto-renewal of team plan, and grace period for non-payment

The billing period for each team plan subscription starts on the date of the
subscription, and is one month long. For example, if your subscription date is
the 15th of May, your next billing period will start on the 15th of June.

All Team plan subscriptions are renewed automatically at the end of the billing
period.

Seven (7) days before the end of your billing period (month), you will receive
an email notification indicating that the end date is approaching. You should
maintain a valid payment method so that we can process your payment and
auto-renew your subscription at the end of the billing period.

At the end of your billing period, if we were unable to renew your payment, you
will enter a grace period of 5 days, during which you must ensure payment.
During the grace period, you will continue to be able to use Iterative Studio in
full capacity. After the grace period expires, you and all your team members
will lose access to your team's views. You will continue to have access to your
team's Settings page. The access to the team's views will be restored once you
clear the pending payment.

Your account's primary email address will be notified after each failed payment.
Payments may be retried up to 4 times within the next billing period. After
this, if the payment does not succeed, you will lose access to your team's
views. To restore the access, go to the `Plan and billing` section of your
team's settings page. Then, click on `Add payment method` to submit a valid
payment method so that the payment succeeds.

## Payment processor and accepted payment methods

For payments for the Team plan, we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to process
your payment. We do not handle your payment information, including credit card
details, directly. We are PCI compliant and your payment information is handled
securely by Stripe.

For the Team plan, we accept the following cards: Visa, Mastercard, American
Express, Discover, Diners Club and JCB. You can change your payment method and
billing address for the Team plan at any time by going to the `Plan and billing`
section of your team's Settings. You will be redirected to Stripe to make these
changes.

## Accessing your payment history and invoices

On your team settings page, you will find a link to your dashboard on Stripe. On
this dashboard, you can get a copy of your invoice as well as your payment
history.

## Frequently asked questions
