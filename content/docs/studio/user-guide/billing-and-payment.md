# Billing and Payment

Studio is free for individuals and teams with up to 2 members. The Free plan is
designed for teams that are starting out: you can invite one other team member
and import as many repositories as you want.

For more advanced collaboration, you can switch to the Basic or Enterprise
plans. These are paid plans, and in this page you will learn how to manage
billing and payment for them.

## How total price is calculated

For Basic plans, invoice amount is calculated based on the number of seats in
the team. All invoice amounts are calculated for one billing period at a time. A
billing period is one month long. The price per seat can be found in the
Iterative Studio [pricing page](https://studio.iterative.ai/pricing).

For example, suppose you have a team with 5 seats. At a monthly rate of $40 per
seat, the total payable amount for the team would be $40 x 5 = $200 per month.

Increasing or decreasing the number of seats during a billing period will result
in prorated amount calculation (see the next section for an example).

For the Enterprise plan, all invoice amounts are calculated based on the
agreement between you and Iterative.

### How increasing or decreasing the number of seats affects price

If you add members to available seats or remove members without reducing the
number of seats in your team, there will be no price impact.

If you increase the number of seats, your account will be charged a prorated
amount based on the time remaining in the billing period at the time each seat
was added. For instance, if your billing period runs from the 15th of last month
to the 14th of this month, then, if you add 2 seats on the 10th of this month,
you will be charged for only 5 days of the 2 new seats. In the following billing
period, the 2 additional seats will be charged for the entire billing period.

If you decrease the number of seats, you will receive an account credit for the
prorated difference. It will be applied automatically for future payment.

## Downgrading a plan

You can decrease the number of seats in your plan at any point, as explained in
the previous section.

To cancel the Basic plan and move back to the Free plan, decrease the number of
seats in the team to 1 or 2 and click on `Downgrade`. A prorated credit will be
added to your account for the remaining days in the billing period. It will be
applied automatically for future payment.

When you downgrade from the Basic plan to the Free plan, you will receive a
prorated refund for the days remaining in the billing period. For inquiries
about refunds, please [contact us].

To upgrade to or downgrade from the Enterprise plan, please [contact us].

## Billing period and auto-renewal of Basic plans

The billing period for each Basic plan subscription starts on the date of the
subscription and is one month long. For example, if your subscription date is
the 15th of May, your next billing period will start on the 15th of June.

Basic plan subscriptions are renewed automatically for one more month at the end
of each billing period.

Seven (7) days before the end of your billing period you will receive an email
notification indicating that the end date is approaching. You should maintain a
valid payment method so that we can process your payment and auto-renew your
subscription at the end of the billing period.

## Grace period for non-payment

At the end of your billing period, if we were unable to process your payment,
you will enter a grace period of 5 days during which you must provide valid
payment. During this time you will continue to have full access to Iterative
Studio.

Your account's primary email address will be notified after each failed payment.
Payments may be retried up to 4 times. To provide a new payment method, go to
the `Plan and billing` section of your [team settings] page and click on
`Add payment method`.

After the grace period expires, you and all your team members will lose access
to your team's projects. You will continue to have access to your team settings
page. Access to the team's projects will be restored once you clear the pending
balance.

## Payment processor and accepted payment methods

not handle your payment information (including credit card details) directly. We
are PCI compliant and your payment information is handled securely by Stripe.

We accept the following cards: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover,
Diners Club and JCB. You can change your payment method and billing address for
the Basic plan at any time by going to the `Plan and billing` section of your
team settings. You will be redirected to Stripe to make these changes.
