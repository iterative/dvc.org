# Connect a Custom GitLab Server

If your team’s Git repositories are on a self-hosted GitLab server, you can set
up a connection to this server such that all your team members can connect to
the Git repositories on this server. Refer to the
[GitLab docs](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) for more details about
self-hosted GitLab servers.

To connect to your self-hosted GitLab server, you will need the following:

- A URL for your GitLab server. The URL should either be publicly accessible, or
  in the same private network as Iterative Studio if Iterative Studio is
  deployed on-premises.
- A personal access token with the following roles: `api`, `read_user`,
  `read_repository`. If you do not have a personal access token yet, you can
  create one at

  `\<your GitLab server URL>/-/profile/personal_access_tokens?name=Iterative+Studio+Access+token&scopes=api,read_user,read_repository`

Once you have obtained the URL and Personal Access Token for your GitLab server,
do the following:

- Go to you team’s settings at
  `https://studio.iterative.ai/team/<your team name>/settings`
- In the `GitLab connections` section, click on the `Connect GitLab server`
  button
- Enter the URL and token in the form that opens up
- Click on `Connect`

Once the connection is successful, all the repositories in this GitLab server
will become available when you try to add a project in your team workspace. If
you have any trouble setting up the connection to your GitLab server, please
[contact us](/doc/studio/troubleshooting#support).

Connecting to a self-hosted GitLab server is different from connecting to your
account on GitLab SaaS ([gitlab.com](http://gitlab.com/)). To connect to GitLab
SaaS go to the `Git integrations` section in your
[personal profile settings](https://studio.iterative.ai/user/_/profile). If you
signed up to use Iterative Studio using your GitLab account, you may already
have the connection.

Custom GitLab server support is available only within a team workspace, and is
available to all Iterative Studio teams (free and paid).
