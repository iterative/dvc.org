# Account Management

To manage your user account, click on your avatar on the top right corner of
Iterative Studio. In the menu that comes up, click on `Profile`. Your user
profile page will open. This page has multiple sections that are described
below.

## Profile

Here, you can see your name and profile picture. If you signed up with a
GitHub.com, GitLab.com or Bitbucket.org account, these details are fetched from
your connected Git account.

You can edit your name.

## Account

Here, you can see your username, password and email addresses. If you signed up
with a GitHub.com, GitLab.com or Bitbucket.org, the username and email address
are fetched from your connected Git account.

You can update your username and password.

You can also add multiple email addresses. For each new email address that you
add, you will receive an email with a link to verify the email address. One of
your email addresses must be designated as primary.

## Git integrations

In this section, you can,

- Connect to the following Git providers: GitHub.com, GitLab.com, Bitbucket.org.

  When you connect to a Git providers, you may be prompted to Grant access to
  your account to Iterative Studio. Please grant the required access to enable
  Iterative Studio to connect to your Git repositories.

  If you signed up to use Studio with an email address, you will not have any of
  the Git connections when you first sign in to Studio, and you can set up the
  required Git connections in this section.

  Note that **connections to self-hosted GitLab servers** are not managed in
  this section. If you want to connect to a self-hosted GitLab server, you
  should create a team and set up the GitLab server connection in the team
  settings. For more details, refer
  [here](/doc/studio/user-guide/connect-custom-gitlab-server).

- Disconnect from your GitHub.com, GitLab.com or Bitbucket.org accounts.
- Configure your GitHub.com account connection. That is, install the Iterative
  Studio GitHub app on additional organizations or repositories, or even remove
  the app from organizations or repositories where you no longer need it.

## Cloud credentials

Here, you can see all the credentials you have added for your cloud / data
remotes. You can also add new credentials as well as edit or delete existing
credentials. The credentials that you add here will become available to use with
your views.

## Delete account

You can delete your account. However, this will permanently delete all the views
you own and the links that you have shared. So, click on `Delete my account`
only if you are absolutely sure that you do not need those views or links
anymore.
