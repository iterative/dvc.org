# Account Management

To manage your user account, click on your avatar on the top right corner of
Iterative Studio. In the menu that comes up, click on `Profile`. Your user
profile page will open. This page has multiple sections that are described
below.

## Account

Here, you can see your avatar, user name and email address. These details are
fetched from your connected Git account and cannot be changed.

## Git integrations

In this section, you can,

- Connect to additional Git providers. For instance, if you are currently
  connected only to GitHub, you can connect to GitLab and/or Bitbucket from
  here. When you connect to the additional Git providers, you may be prompted to
  Grant access to your account to Iterative Studio. Please grant the required
  access to enable Iterative Studio to connect to your Git repositories.
- Disconnect from your GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket accounts.
- Configure your GitHub account. That is, install the Iterative Studio GitHub
  app on additional organizations or repositories, or even remove the app from
  organizations or repositories where you no longer need it.

## Cloud credentials

Here, you can see all the credentials you have added for your cloud / data
remotes. You can also add new credentials as well as edit or delete existing
credentials. The credentials that you add here will become available to use with
your views.

## Delete account

You can delete your account. However, this will permanently delete all the views
you own and the links that you have shared. So, click on `Delete my account`
only if you are absolutely sure that you do not need those views or links
anymore.
