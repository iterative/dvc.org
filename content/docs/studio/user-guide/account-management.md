# Account Management

To manage your user account, click on your avatar on the top right corner of
Iterative Studio. In the menu that comes up, click on `Profile`. Your user
profile page will open. This page has multiple sections that are described
below.

## Profile

Here, you can see your name and profile picture. If you signed up with a
GitHub.com, GitLab.com or Bitbucket.org account, these details are fetched from
your connected Git hosting account.

You can edit your name.

## Account

Here, you can see your username, password and email addresses. If you signed up
with a GitHub.com, GitLab.com or Bitbucket.org account, the username and email
address are fetched from your connected Git hosting account.

You can update your username and password.

**Managing email addresses:**

You can add multiple email addresses to a single Studio account. You can login
to the account with any of your verified email addresses.

One of your email addresses must be designated as primary. This is the address
to which Studio will send all your account notification emails.

You can change your primary email address by clicking on the `Primary` button
next to the email address which you want to designate as primary.

You can delete your non-primary email addresses.

## Git integrations

In this section, you can,

- Connect to GitHub.com, GitLab.com or Bitbucket.org.

  When you connect to a Git provider, you may be prompted to grant access to
  your account to Iterative Studio. Please grant the required access to enable
  Iterative Studio to connect to your Git repositories.

  If you signed up to use Studio with an email address, you will not have any of
  the Git connections when you first sign in to Studio, and you can set up the
  required Git connections in this section.

  Note that **connections to self-hosted GitLab servers** are not managed in
  this section. If you want to connect to a self-hosted GitLab server, you
  should create a team and set up the GitLab server connection in the team
  settings. For more details, refer
  [here](/doc/studio/user-guide/connect-custom-gitlab-server).

- Disconnect from your GitHub.com, GitLab.com or Bitbucket.org accounts.
- Configure your GitHub account connection. That is, install the Iterative
  Studio GitHub app on additional organizations or repositories, or even remove
  the app from organizations or repositories where you no longer need it.

## Cloud credentials

Here, you can see all the credentials you have added for your cloud / data
remotes. You can also add new credentials as well as edit or delete existing
credentials. The credentials that you add here will become available to use with
your views.

## Delete account

You can delete your account. However, this will permanently delete all the views
you own and the links that you have shared. So, click on `Delete my account`
only if you are absolutely sure that you do not need those views or links
anymore.
