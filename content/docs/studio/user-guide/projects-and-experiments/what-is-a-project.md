# What is a project in Iterative Studio

A project in Iterative Studio is an interactive representation of the ML
datasets, hyperparameters, models and metrics defined in your Git repositories.
These values are configured in your project's `dvc.yaml` file. Additionally,
live metrics that you [send to Iterative Studio][live-metrics-and-plots] using
[DVCLive] are also included in the project.

Within a project, you can:

- [Explore all the details of the experiments][explore-ml-experiments] that you
  have pushed to your Git repository.
- [Visualize the experiments][visualize] using plots and trend charts.
- [Compare experiments][compare].
- [Run new experiments][run-experiments], including on your own cloud instances,
  directly from Iterative Studio.
- [Track live metrics and plots][live-metrics-and-plots] by sending them to
  Iterative Studio by using [DVCLive].

# Prepare your repositories

To **display your project's content** in Iterative Studio,
[**initialize DVC**](https://dvc.org/doc) in your project's Git repository and
create `dvc.yaml`. When running model training and evaluation, save metrics and
plots in the files defined in `dvc.yaml`. [DVCLive] can do this for you
automatically.

You can also use the `dvc exp push` command to **push experiments without
creating separate Git commits** for them. To notify Iterative Studio when you
push experiments using `dvc exp push`,
[configure the `DVC_STUDIO_TOKEN` environment variable](/doc/studio/user-guide/projects-and-experiments/live-metrics-and-plots#set-up-an-access-token).

If you are working with a **non-DVC repository**, you can
[indicate which files contain metrics and hyperparameters](/doc/studio/user-guide/projects-and-experiments/configure-a-project#custom-metrics-and-parameters)
that Iterative Studio should display in the project. However, we strongly
recommend using DVC to avail of all the features of Iterative Studio.

To **run new experiments** from Iterative Studio, add credentials with
sufficient access. Optionally, integrate with CI to run experiments
automatically on CI triggers. [Learn more][run-experiments]

To **track live metrics and plots** of running experiments, configure the
`DVC_STUDIO_TOKEN` environment variable and use DVCLive in your training
pipeline. You can also do this for experiments that you run from Iterative
Studio if you configure the CI job accordingly. [Learn

To **add model metadata** to your repositories, you can use Iterative Studio
Model Registry, or the underlying [GTO] or [MLEM]. [Learn more][model-registry]
