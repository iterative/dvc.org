# Explore ML Experiments

The projects dashboard in Iterative Studio contains all the projects you created
by connecting to Git repositories. To explore all ML experiments in a project,
visualize and compare them, and run new experiments, open the project by
clicking the project name (in this case, `example-get-started`).

An experiments table for the project will be generated as shown below. This
includes metrics, hyperparameters, and information about datasets and models.

## Components of a project

The major components of the project experimentation table are:

- [Git history and live experiments](#git-history-and-live-metrics) that show
  you the complete experimentation history as well as live metrics of running
  experiments.
- [Display preferences](#display-preferences) that let you show/hide branches,
  commits and columns, and re-arrange the table.
- Buttons to
  [visualize, compare, and run experiments](#visualize-compare-and-run-experiments).
- Button to [export project data](#export-project-data).

### Git history and live experiments

The branches and commits in your Git repository are displayed along with the
corresponding models, metrics, hyperparameters, and DVC-tracked files.

[New experiments submitted from Iterative Studio][run-experiments] appear as
experiment commits, which are eventually pushed to Git. Experiments that you
push using the `dvc exp push` command as well as any live experiments that you
send using [DVCLive] are displayed in a special experiment row nested under the
parent Git commit. More details of how live experiments are displayed can be
found
[here](/doc/studio/user-guide/projects-and-experiments/live-metrics-and-plots#view-live-metrics-and-plots).

To manually check for updates in your repository, use the `Reload` button ðŸ”„
located above the project table.

<!-- To do: Replace the following image with one that contains dvc exp and live experiment rows.-->

### Display preferences

The table contains buttons to specify filters and other preferences regarding
which commits and columns to display.

![](https://static.iterative.ai/img/studio/view_components_2.gif)

#### Filters:

You can filter the commits that you want to display by the following fields:

- **Branch:** The Git branch
- **Tag:** The Git tag
- **Author:** Author of the Git commit
- **Metric:** Values of different metrics. For instance, you can display only
  those experiments for which the value of `avg_prec` is greater than `0.9`.
- **Metric delta:** Change in the value of the metric. For instance, you can use
  this filter to only display those experiments for which the value of
  `avg_prec` changed by more than `0.1` compared to the baseline experiment.
- **Param:** Values of different parameters
- **File size:** Size of the data, model and other files corresponding to your
  experiments
- **File changed:** Whether or not any given file changed in the experiment

#### Columns:

Select the columns you want to display and hide the rest.
![Showing and hiding columns](https://static.iterative.ai/img/studio/show_hide_columns.gif)

Additionally, you can click and drag the columns in the table to rearrange them
as per your preferences.

If your project is missing some required columns or includes columns that you do
not want, refer to the following troubleshooting sections to understand why this
may have happened.

- [Project does not contain the columns that I want](/doc/studio/troubleshooting#project-does-not-contain-the-columns-that-i-want)
- [Project contains columns that I did not import](/doc/studio/troubleshooting#project-contains-columns-that-i-did-not-import)

#### Hide commits:

The following functionality are available for you to hide irrelevant commits
from the table.

- **Iterative Studio auto-hides irrelevant commits:**Â Iterative Studio
  identifies commits where metrics, files and hyperparameters did not change and
  hides them automatically.
- **Iterative Studio auto-hides commits that contain `[skip studio]` in the
  commit message:**Â This is particularly useful if your workflow creates
  multiple commits per experiment and you would like to hide all those commits
  except the final one.

  For example, suppose you create a Git commit with hyper-parameter changes for
  running a new experiment, and your training CI job creates a new Git commit
  with the experiment results. You may want to hide the first commit and only
  display the second commit, which has the new values for the hyper-parameters
  as well as experiment results (metrics). For this, you can use the string
  `[skip studio]` in the commit message of the first commit.

- **Hide commits and branches manually:** You can selectively hide commits and
  branches. This can be useful if there are commits that do not add much value
  in your project. To hide a commit or branch, click on the 3-dot menu next to
  the commit or branch name and click on `Hide commit` or `Hide branch`.
- **Unhide commits:** You can unhide commits as needed, so that you don't lose
  any experimentation history.Â To display all hidden commits, click on the
  `Show hidden commits` toggle (refer [the above gif](#display-preferences)).
  This will display all hidden commits, with a `hidden` (closed eye) indicator.
  To unhide any commit, click on the 3-dot menu for that commit and click on
  `Show commit`.

#### Selected only:

Use this toggle switch to show/hide experiments that you have not selected.

#### Delta mode:

Toggle between absolute values and difference from the first row.

#### Save changes:

Save your filters or column display preferences so that these preferences remain
intact even after you log out of Iterative Studio and log back in later.

### Visualize, compare and run experiments.

The table also contains buttons to visualize, compare and run experiments.

![](https://static.iterative.ai/img/studio/view_components_3.gif)

- **Show plots:** Show plots for the selected commits. When you click on this
  button, plots for the selected commits are displayed in a `Plots ` pane.
- **Compare:** Compare different experiments side by side.
- **Run:** Run experiments by selecting any one commit. Refer
  [here][run-experiments] for details on how to run experiments and track
  metrics in real time.
- **Trends:** Generate trend charts to show metric evolution over time.

### Export project data

The button to export data from the project table to CSV is present next to the
[`Delta mode`](#delta-mode) button.
