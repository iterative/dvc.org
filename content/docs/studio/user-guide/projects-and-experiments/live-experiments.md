# Generate live (real-time) metrics and plots for running experiments

In your model training script, you can use [DVCLive] to send live experiment
updates to metrics and plots to Iterative Studio, without writing them to your
Git repository. This will enable you to view all intermediate results in
Iterative Studio while your experiment is still running.

This requires a 2-step process:

1. [Set up an access token](#set-up-an-access-token)
2. [Send and view the updates](#send-and-view-live-metrics-and-plots)

## Set up an access token

Iterative Studio uses access tokens to authorize DVC and [DVCLive] to send live
experiment updates. The access token must be present in any request that sends
data to the Iterative Studio ingestion endpoint. Requests with missing or
incorrect access tokens are rejected with an appropriate HTTP error code and
error message.

The access token is also used by DVC to notify Iterative Studio when you push
experiments using `dvc exp push`.

### Create and manage access token

Open your user profile page. In the `Studio access token` section, click on
`Generate new token`. You can also regenerate or delete your access token.

The option to delete the access token is also available when you change your
password, so that you can reset all your access credentials at once. This is
handy if you suspect that your account security may have been compromised.

### Provide access token to experiment

If you are running the experiment locally, you can set the token in your [DVC
config]. For example, to set it globally for all of a user's projects:

```cli
$ dvc config --global studio.token ***
```

If you are running the experiment as part of a CI job, a secure way to provide
the access token is to create a
[GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
containing the value of the token, and use the secret in your CI job using the
`DVC_STUDIO_TOKEN` environment variable (see example below).

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Train model
    env:
      DVC_STUDIO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DVC_STUDIO_TOKEN }}
```

See [DVC config] for how to enable/disable live experiment updates and how to
configure a different Studio URL or Git repository.

## Send and view live metrics and plots

In the training job (which has been configured as detailed above), whenever you
log your metrics or plots using [DVCLive], they will be automatically sent to
Iterative Studio. Here is an example of how you can use [DVCLive] in your
training code:

```py
from dvclive import Live

with Live(save_dvc_exp=True) as live:
  for i in range(params["epochs"]):
    ...
    live.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
    live.next_step()
  ...
```

<admon>

Using `save_dvc_exp=True` will ensure that
[the results get saved as a DVC experiment](/doc/dvclive/how-it-works#track-the-results).

</admon>

<admon type="tip">

DVCLive signals the end of the experiment using `live.end()`. Using
`with Live() as live:` or one of the integrations for
[ML Frameworks](/doc/dvclive/ml-frameworks) ensures that `live.end()` is
automatically called when the experiment concludes successfully.

</admon>

Iterative Studio stores the live experiments data in its database.

In the project table, the live experiments are displayed in experiment rows,
which are nested under the parent Git commit.

<admon>

The live experiments row for an experiment is displayed only if its parent Git
commit is shown in the project table. So before you run the experiment, make
sure that its parent commit is pushed to Git.

</admon>

Updates to the live experiments are highlighted (in orange) in the project table
and
[compare pane](/doc/studio/user-guide/projects-and-experiments/visualize-and-compare#compare-experiments)
in real time.

The number of live experiments with recent updates are displayed in the `Live`
icon, which can also be used to filter and show only running experiments in the
table.

Live plots are displayed in the
[plots pane](/doc/studio/user-guide/projects-and-experiments/visualize-and-compare#how-to-generate-plots).
You can see them getting populated as Studio receives new updates.

An experiment can have one of the following statuses:

- **Running** - Iterative Studio expects to receive live metrics and plots for
  these experiments.

  <admon type="warn">

  If the experiment stops due to any error, Iterative Studio will not be aware
  of this and it will continue to wait for live updates. In this case, you can
  delete the row from the project table.

  </admon>

- **Completed** - Iterative Studio does not expect to receive any more updates
  for these experiments. Once the experiment concludes, you can delete the row
  from the project table.

  <admon type="warn">

  Iterative Studio does not automatically commit and push the final results of
  your experiment to Git. You can [share] the experiment or [save] it using
  appropriate DVC and Git commands.

  </admon>

<admon>

If there are multiple projects connected to a single Git repository, then live
experiments for this repository are displayed in all its connected projects.
