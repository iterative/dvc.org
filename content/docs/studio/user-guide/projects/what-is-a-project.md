**We have renamed Views to Projects in Iterative Studio.**

Accordingly, _Views dashboard_ is now called _Projects dashboard_; _View
settings_ are now called _Project settings_; and so on.

# What Is a Project in Iterative Studio

A project in Iterative Studio is an interactive representation of the
information stored in your Git repository.

When you connect to your Git repository from Iterative Studio, the experiments
committed in the repository are parsed to identify all the data, metrics and
hyperparameters. These values are then presented in an experiment table with
each experiment (Git commit) in a row and the corresponding values for the data,
metrics and hyperparameters in columns.

All the projects that you have created are presented in a central dashboard.
This dashboard opens up whenever you login to Iterative Studio.

Within a project, you can:

- Explore all the details of the experiments that you have pushed to your Git
  repository.
- Visualize the experiments using plots and trend charts.
- Compare experiments.
- Run new experiments by submitting new Git commits directly from Iterative
  Studio.

In the following sections, you will see how to create, configure and share
projects.
