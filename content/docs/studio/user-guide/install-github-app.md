# DVC Studio GitHub App Installation

If you are using a GitHub account, you will have to install the DVC Studio
GitHub app on the GitHub repositories/organizations that you want to use with
DVC Studio. When you try to create a view, if the app is not already installed,
DVC Studio will not be able to fetch the list of your GitHub repositories. In
this case, you will be prompted to configure Git integrations as shown below.

You can specify the level of authorization that you want to grant to DVC Studio:

- To authorize DVC Studio on all the repositories in your GitHub account, select
  `All repositories`.
- To limit access to only specific repositories, select
  `Only select repositories`. Then select the repositories which you want to use
  with DVC Studio.

Finally, click on `Install & Authorize`.
