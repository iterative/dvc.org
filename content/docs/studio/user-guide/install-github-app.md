# Iterative Studio GitHub App Installation

If you are using a GitHub account, you will have to install the Iterative Studio
GitHub app on the GitHub repositories/organizations that you want to use with
Iterative Studio. When you try to create a view, if the app is not already
installed, Iterative Studio will not be able to fetch the list of your GitHub
repositories. In this case, you will be prompted to configure Git integrations
as shown below.

You can specify the level of authorization that you want to grant to Iterative
Studio:

- To authorize Iterative Studio on all the repositories in your GitHub account,
  select `All repositories`.
- To limit access to only specific repositories, select
  `Only select repositories`. Then select the repositories which you want to use
  with Iterative Studio.

Finally, click on `Install & Authorize`.
