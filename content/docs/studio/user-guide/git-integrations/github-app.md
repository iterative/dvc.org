# Install the Iterative Studio GitHub App

If you are using a GitHub account, you can install the Iterative Studio app on
the repositories or organizations that you want to use it with.

When you try to create a project, if the app is not already installed, Iterative
Studio will not be able to fetch the list of your GitHub repositories. In this
case, you will be prompted to configure Git integrations as shown below.

Click on the link to `Configure Git integrations settings`. This will open the
[`Git integrations` section of your profile page](/doc/studio/user-guide/account-management#git-integrations).

to install and authorize the Iterative Studio GitHub app.

You can specify the level of authorization that you want to grant:

- To authorize Iterative Studio on all the repositories in your GitHub account,
  select `All repositories`.
- To limit access to only specific repositories, select
  `Only select repositories`. Then select the repositories which you want to use
  with Iterative Studio.

Finally, click on `Install & Authorize`.
