# Git integrations

If you sign up to use Iterative Studio using your GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket
account, integration with that Git account gets created during sign up. If you
sign with your email address, you will need to
[set up the Git integrations](/doc/studio/user-guide/account-management#git-integrations).
This is also needed if you want to connect to more than one Git provider.

To **connect to your GitHub repositories**, you must
[install the Iterative Studio GitHub app](/doc/studio/user-guide/install-github-app).

To **connect to a self-hosted GitLab server**, you should create a team and
[set up the GitLab server connection](/doc/studio/user-guide/git-integrations/custom-gitlab-server).

You can **remove a Git integration** from your account by visiting the
[Git integrations sections of your profile page](/doc/studio/user-guide/account-management#git-integrations).
