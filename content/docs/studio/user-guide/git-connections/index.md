# Git connections

If you sign up to use DVC Studio using your GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket account,
connection with that Git account gets created during sign up. If you sign in
with your email address, you will need to
[set up the Git connections](/doc/studio/user-guide/account-management#git-connections).
This is also needed if you want to connect to more than one Git provider.

To **connect to your GitHub repositories**, you must
[install the DVC Studio GitHub app](/doc/studio/user-guide/git-connections/github-app).

To **connect to a self-hosted GitLab server**, you should create a team and
[set up the GitLab server connection](/doc/studio/user-guide/git-connections/custom-gitlab-server).

You can **remove a Git connection** from your account by visiting the
[Git connections section](/doc/studio/user-guide/account-management#git-connections)
of your profile page.
