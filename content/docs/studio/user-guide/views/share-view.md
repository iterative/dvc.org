# Share a View

You can [share a view within a team](#share-a-view-within-a-team). You can also
[make a view public](#make-a-view-public) to share it on the web.

## Share a view within a team

Each team that you [create in Iterative Studio](/doc/studio/user-guide/teams)
will have its own views dashboard. All the views that you create in the team's
dashboard will be accessible to all members (collaborators) of the team.

To add more than 2 collaborators in your team, you can
[upgrade it to the **Team** or **Enterprise** plan](/doc/studio/user-guide/change-team-plan-and-size).

## Make a view public

To share a view on the web (i.e., to make the view public), click on the button
labeled `Private` next to the name of the view. In the menu that pops up, turn
on `Share to Web`.

You can change a shared (public) view and make it private by turning off
`Share to web`.

Views that are shared on the web can be opened by anyone, including people who
are not logged in to Iterative Studio. These anonymous users have the `Visitor`
role. Their access is limited to opening the view, applying filters, and
showing/hiding columns for themselves without making permanent changes to the
view. Refer to the [Roles](/doc/studio/user-guide/teams#roles) section for
details on the features available for different roles.
