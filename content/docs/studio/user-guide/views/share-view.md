# Share a View

To share a view on the web (i.e., to make the view public), click on the button
labelled `Private` next to the name of the view. In the menu that pops up, turn
on `Share to Web`.

You can change a shared (public) view and make it private by turning off
`Share to web`.

Views that are shared on the web can be opened by anyone, including people who
are not logged in to DVC Studio. These anonymous users have the `Visitor` role.
Their access is limited to opening the view, applying filters, and
showing/hiding columns for themselves without making permanent changes to the
view. Refer to the [Roles](/doc/studio/user-guide/teams#roles) section for
details on the features available for different roles.
