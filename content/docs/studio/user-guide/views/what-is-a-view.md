# What Is a View

A view is an interactive representation of the information stored in your Git
repository.

When you connect to your Git repository from DVC Studio, the experiments
committed in the repository are parsed to identify all the data, metrics and
hyperparameters. These values are then presented in a table with each experiment
(Git commit) in a row and the corresponding values for the data, metrics and
hyperparameters in columns. This tabular representation is called a view, and
all the views that you have created are also presented in a central dashboard.

In the view, you can:

- Explore all the details of the experiments that you have pushed to your Git
  repository.
- Visualize the experiments using plots and trend charts.
- Compare experiments.
- Run new experiments by submitting new Git commits directly from DVC Studio.

In the following sections, you will see how to create, configure and share
views.
