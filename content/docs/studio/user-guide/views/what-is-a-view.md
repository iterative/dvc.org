# What Is a View

A view is an interactive representation of the information stored in your Git
repository.

When you connect to your Git repository from Iterative Studio, the experiments
committed in the repository are parsed to identify all the data, metrics and
hyperparameters. These values are then presented in a table with each experiment
(Git commit) in a row and the corresponding values for the data, metrics and
hyperparameters in columns. This tabular representation is called a view.

All the views that you have created are presented in a central dashboard. This
dashboard opens up whenever you login to Iterative Studio.

that you create are presented in a views dashboard for easy access._

In the view, you can:

- Explore all the details of the experiments that you have pushed to your Git
  repository.
- Visualize the experiments using plots and trend charts.
- Compare experiments.
- Run new experiments by submitting new Git commits directly from Iterative
  Studio.

In the following sections, you will see how to create, configure and share
views.
