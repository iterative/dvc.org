# How Iterative Studio Works

[Iterative Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) works very closely with your
Git ecosystem. It parses the metadata found in your ML project repositories to
present organized data, hyperparameters, models, and metrics on a web UI. It
also parses and displays live metrics and plots sent by [DVCLive]; these don't
need to be pushed to the Git repositories.

The following video illustrates how Iterative Studio works with data from your
ML projects and experiments.

Note that we have renamed DVC Studio to Iterative Studio and Views to Projects.

## How to save your project data

- Using [DVC] and [Git], you will push all your ML experiments to your GitHub,
  GitLab or Bitbucket repositories.
- Using Iterative Studio, or using [GTO] and possibly [MLEM], you will push
  information about your ML models as Git commits and tags.
- Using [DVCLive], you will push live metrics and plots from your experiments to
  Iterative Studio.

## How Iterative Studio extracts your project data

- When you connect to the Git repositories from Iterative Studio, the project's
  `dvc.yaml` is used to identify all the data, metrics and hyperparameters in
  your experiments.
- If you are not using DVC, you can
  [add the metrics and hyperparameters to your Git repositories manually](/doc/studio/user-guide/projects-and-experiments/configure-a-project#custom-metrics-and-parameters).
- Details of your ML models, including versions and stage assignments, are
  extracted from the Git commits and tags.
- Live metrics and plots for experiments committed to Git are extracted from the
  data you send using [DVCLive].

## How Iterative Studio presents your project data

- Iterative Studio creates an
  [interactive, tabular representation](/doc/studio/user-guide/projects-and-experiments/explore-ml-experiments#components-of-a-project)
  of all the identified values, including live metrics.
- All the projects that you have created are presented in a central projects
  dashboard.
- All identified models are included in an interactive
  [models dashboard](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/view-models#models-dashboard)
  and individual
  [model details pages](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/view-models#model-details-page).

## How Iterative Studio runs experiments and model actions

- When you [run new experiments] or
  [add models to your model registry](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/add-a-model)
  in Iterative Studio, it creates Git commits and pull requests with the
  changes.
- You can set up your CI/CD actions (e.g. GitHub Actions) to run model training
  upon the creation of Git commits, tags or pull requests. You can use [CML] in
  your CI/CD actions for continuous machine learning. And you can use [DVCLive]
  to [send live updates for training metrics and plots to Iterative
  Studio][live-metrics-and-plots].
- When you
  [register new versions](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/register-version)
  of your ML models or
  [assign stages](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/assign-stage) to them,
  Iterative Studio creates annotated Git tags representing the actions.
