# Visualize and compare experiements

You can visualize and compare experiements using a variety of tools.

## Generate metric plots

You can visualize certain metrics of machine learning experiments as plots.
Usual plot examples are AUC curves, loss functions, confusion matrices, among
others. This type of metrics files are created by users, or generated by user
data processing code, and can be defined in dvc.yaml (plots field) for tracking
(optional). Refer to the [DVC plots documentation](/doc/command-reference/plots)
for details on how plots are generated.

To generate metric plots, select one or more experiements (represented by the
commits), and click on the 'Plots' icon.

The plots will appear below the tabular display. If you have selected more than
one experiment, you can use the plots to compare them.

_Here, 2 experiments were selected comparison using plots._

## Generate trend charts

Click on the Trends button to generate a plot of how the metrics changed over
the course of the different experiments.

## Compare experiements

To compare different experiements, select two or more experiements (represented
by the commits), and click on the 'Compare' icon.
