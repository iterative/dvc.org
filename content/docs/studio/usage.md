# Usage Guide
Here, we will walk you through a tutorial to use DVC Studio for collaboration on your ML projects. You will need access to Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket account which has the Git repositories that you want to connect to from DVC Studio. When you connect to the repositories, DVC Studio creates views from those repositories.

In your browser, open https://viewer.iterative.ai/ Sign in with your Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket account.

When you first login, you will find that there already exists a view connecting to a public Git repository for an example DVC project. Use this view to explore the features that DVC Studio has to offer.

## Components of a view
Each view on the dashboard displays the default metrics. In the example view, you can see that avg_prec and roc_auc metrics are displayed.

You can dive deep into all the experiments committed to the repo. For this, open the view by clicking on the view name (in this case, example-get-started).

A detailed display of your view will be generated as shown below.

You can connect to additional repositories and add more views as needed. In the next section, we will show you how you can do this.
