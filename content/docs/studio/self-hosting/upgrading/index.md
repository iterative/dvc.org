# Upgrading Studio

The procedure for upgrading Studio varies depends on the environment Studio is
deployed onto.

If you've deployed Studio in an environment with internet access (like most
users), follow this guide:
[Upgrading Studio (Regular procedure)](/doc/studio/self-hosting/upgrading/regular-procedure)

If, on the other hand, you've deployed Studio in an air-gapped environment,
follow this guide:
[Upgrading Studio (Air-gap procedure)](/doc/studio/self-hosting/upgrading/airgap-procedure)
