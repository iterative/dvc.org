# Upgrading DVC Studio

The procedure for upgrading DVC Studio varies depends on the environment DVC
Studio is deployed onto.

If you've deployed DVC Studio in an environment with internet access (like most
users), follow this guide:

If, on the other hand, you've deployed DVC Studio in an air-gapped environment,
follow this guide:
[Upgrading DVC Studio (Air-gap procedure)](/doc/studio/self-hosting/upgrading/airgap-procedure)
