# 502 Service Unavailable

Getting HTTP 502 Service Unavailable when accessing DVC Studio in your browser
indicates that DVC Studio failed to launch. This error could be caused by
several things, each of which we will explore below:

## Initial diagnosis

<admon type="info">

If you've deployed DVC Studio with the AMI, you'll need to SSH to the EC2
instance before continuing.

</admon>

Let's get a list of the DVC Studio components and their statuses:

```cli
$ kubectl get pods -n studio
```

If any components have a status such as `ImagePullBackOff` or `ErrImagePull`,
jump to the [Fixing the Docker credentials](#fixing-the-docker-credentials)
section.

### Fixing the Docker credentials

Delete the existing credentials:

```cli
$ kubectl delete secret iterativeai -n studio
```

Recreate the credentials:

```cli
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry iterativeai \
    --namespace studio \
    --docker-server=docker.iterative.ai \
    --docker-username=<username> \
    --docker-password=<password>
```

Now restart all DVC Studio components using:

```cli
$ kubectl rollout restart deploy/studio-beat -n studio
$ kubectl rollout restart deploy/studio-backend -n studio
$ kubectl rollout restart deploy/studio-worker -n studio
$ kubectl rollout restart deploy/studio-ui -n studio
```

Wait a few seconds and then verify that the issue got resolved:

```cli
$ kubectl get pods -n studio
```

All components should now show `Running` in their statuses.
