# Git Forges

Studio integrates with several Git forges (also referred to as SCM providers),
each of which are configured differently. For any Git forge type you'll need to
configure an app prior to Studio installation, and also configure a dedicated
block under `scmProviders` in the `values.yaml` file:

- [GitHub](/doc/studio/self-hosting/configuration/git-forges/github)
- [GitLab](/doc/studio/self-hosting/configuration/git-forges/gitlab)
- [Bitbucket](/doc/studio/self-hosting/configuration/git-forges/bitbucket)

<admon type="tip">

If your Git forge uses a certificate signed by a custom certificate authority,
see [CA certificates](/doc/studio/self-hosting/configuration/ca)
