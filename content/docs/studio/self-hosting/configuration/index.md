# Configuration

Studio gets provisioned by Helm, which uses a single YAML file for
configuration, often referred to as `values.yaml` in our documentation.

To learn more about Helm's configuration format, refer to the page
[Values Files ](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/) on the
Helm website.

## Updating the configuration

<admon type="info">

If you've deployed Studio with the AMI, you'll need to SSH to the EC2 instance
before continuing.

To update the configuration and apply the changes, follow the instructions
below:

1. Update Studio's `values.yaml` config file

**Example: Updating the hostname**

Merge the existing `values.yaml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
global:
  host: studio.company2.com
```

3. Reload Studio

```cli
$ helm upgrade --wait studio iterative/studio --namespace studio -f values.yaml
```

## More configuration options

The previous chapter provided a basic example of updating the Studio
configuration. In most cases, you'll likely need to do more configuration to set
up Studio to your needs.

To integrate Studio with your Git forge (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), see the
[Git Forges](/doc/studio/self-hosting/configuration/git-forges) section.

To allow secure access to Studio, we highly recommend setting up a valid TLS
certificate. To set this up, check out the
[TLS certificates](/doc/studio/self-hosting/configuration/tls) page.
