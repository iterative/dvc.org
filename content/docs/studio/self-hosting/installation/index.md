## Self-hosting Studio

Studio Enterprise users can host Iterative Studio on their own infrastructure
(on-premises) or in their cloud accounts.

Please note that our support is needed to make the Studio's cloud/Docker images
available to you to enable installation. Please get in touch with our
[sales team](https://calendly.com/gtm-2/studio-overview?month=2023-03) to
coordinate a meeting.

Below are the supported installation methods:

- [AMI (AWS)](/doc/studio/self-hosting/installation/aws-ami)
- [Kubernetes (Helm)](/doc/studio/self-hosting/installation/k8s-helm)

We recommend deploying Studio in an auto-scaling node group with a minimum of 2
nodes.

Each node should have at least 16 GB of RAM and 4 vCPUs.

Additionally, you'll need 100 GB of block storage for Studio's
`PersistentVolume`

- Celery Worker: Processes background tasks
