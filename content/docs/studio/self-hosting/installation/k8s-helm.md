# K8s Installation using Helm

## Prerequisites

### DVC Studio Images

Access to the DVC Studio Docker images need to be provided by the Iterative team
to enable the installation.

### Software

You can deploy DVC Studio Self-hosted on any Kubernetes cluster (version =>
1.20) that has an ingress controller configured and installed.

The choice of ingress controller is up to you. We recommend the
[ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) controller, but DVC
Studio will work on other ingress controllers as well.

You'll also need to have the following CLI tools configured and installed:

- Helm
- Kubectl

### DNS

Create a DNS record pointing to the external IP address of your ingress
controller. This hostname will be used for DVC Studio.

## 1. Create a namespace

We'll install DVC Studio and related components in a dedicated `studio`
namespace. Let's create it now:

```cli
$ kubectl create namespace studio
```

<admon type="tip">

If you want to install DVC Studio in any other namespace, modify the
`--namespace` flag in the following commands accordingly

</admon>

## 2. Create a Docker registry secret

Configure Docker credentials for pulling images from our private registry:

```cli
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry iterativeai \
    --namespace studio \
    --docker-server=docker.iterative.ai \
    --docker-username=<username> \
    --docker-password=<password>
```

Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the credentials you've received from
the Iterative team.

## 3. Add the Iterative Helm repository

```cli
$ helm repo add iterative https://helm.iterative.ai
```

## 3. Install the DVC Studio Helm chart

In this example, we'll configure DVC Studio to integrate with your Git Forge of
choice and use the built-in Postgres, Redis, and Minio.

<admon info="tip">

For a comprehensive list on DVC Studio's configuration options, please see the
[Configuration documentation](/doc/studio/self-hosting/configuration).

</admon>

Let's start by creating a YAML configuration file, `values.yaml`, with the
following contents:

```yaml
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: iterativeai

global:
  host: '<DVC Studio hostname>'
  envVars:
    SELF_HOSTED_LICENSE_KEY: '<License key provided by the Iterative team>'
```

Here, the `SELF_HOSTED_LICENSE_KEY` is needed for Studio to correctly recognize
your license and allow you to create
[teams](/doc/studio/user-guide/team-collaboration) in Studio with a number of
available seats equivalent to your purchased seat limit.

Next, you need to integrate our Git Forge with your Studio instance. Depending
on the Git Forge you are using follow the corresponding instructions in the
[Git Forges Configuration documentation](/doc/studio/self-hosting/configuration/git-forges).

Finally, deploy DVC Studio with the command:

```cli
$ helm install studio iterative/studio \
    --namespace studio \
    -f values.yaml
```

ðŸŽ‰ You can now access DVC Studio in your browser on the domain (hostname) that
you've configured.
