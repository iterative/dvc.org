# Teams

So far, you have seen how you can create personal and public views. In this
section, we will illustrate how you can create teams. In DVC Studio, you can
define teams with one or more team members. The team members are also called
collaborators, and you can assign different roles to them. The views that you
create in your team's page will be accessible to all members of the team.

## Roles

Team members can have different roles.

- **View.** Users with the View access cannot edit team settings or create new
  views within the team's page. They have read-only access to the views created
  by other team members.
- **Edit.** In addition to accessing all the team's views, users with the Edit
  role can also create new views for the team, edit the views' settings, and run
  experiments.
- **Admin.** Admin users have full access to the team's views and settings. They
  can do everything that viewers and editors can do. Additionally, they can add
  (invite) and remove collaborators as well as change team settings such as
  cloud credentials (data remotes).

## Create a team

To create a team, click on the drop down next to `Personal`. All the teams that
you have created so far will be listed within "Teams" in the drop down menu. If
you have not created any team so far, this list will be empty. Now, click on
`Create a team`. ![](https://static.iterative.ai/img/studio/team_create.png)

You will be asked to enter the URL namespace for your team. Enter a unique name.
The URL for your team will be formed using this name.

Then, click the `Create team` button on the top right corner.

## Invite collaborators

The next step is to invite the team members (or collaborators) for your team.
You can also choose to skip adding collaborators at this point. For this, click
on `Skip and Close` on the top right corner. You will be able to add
collaborators by accessing team settings later.

If you wish to add collaborators now, enter their email addresses. An email
invite will be sent to each invitee, and they will have to join using their
Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket account.

You can add multiple collaborators. Each collaborator can be assigned the Admin,
Edit, or View role. ![](https://static.iterative.ai/img/studio/team_roles.png)

Once you have added the people that you wish to add to your team, click on
`Send Invites and Close` on the top right corner.

## Manage your team and its views

Once you have created the team, the team's page opens up.

On this page, you can perform three types of tasks:

- **Add a view.** Click on the `View` menu item to add views to the team's page.
  The process for adding a view is the same as that for adding personal views
  ([instructions](/doc/studio/create-view)). However, the views that you create
  within the team will be accessible to all members (collaborators) of the team.

- **Edit collaborators.** You can click on the `Team` menu item to edit the
  collaborators in the team.

- **Change settings.** Finally, you can click on the `Settings` menu item to
  change the team name, add credentials for the data remotes, and delete the
  team. ![](https://static.iterative.ai/img/studio/team_settings.png)
