# Storage locations

DVC can manage data anywhere: cloud storage, SSH servers, network resources
(e.g. NAS), mounted drives, local file systems, etc. These locations can be put
into three groups.

![Storage locations](/img/storage-locations.png) _Local, external, and remote
storage locations_

Every <abbr>DVC project</abbr> starts with 2 locations. The
<abbr>workspace</abbr> is the main project directory, containing your data,
models, source code, etc. DVC also creates a <abbr>data cache</abbr> (found
locally in `.dvc/cache` by default), which will be used as fast-access storage
for DVC operations.

<admon type="tip">

The cache can be moved to an external location in the file system or network,
for example to [share it] among several projects. It could even be set up in a
remote system (Internet access), but this is typically too slow for working with
data regularly.

DVC supports additional storage locations such as cloud services (Amazon S3,
Google Drive, Azure Blob Storage, etc.), SSH servers, network-attached storage,
etc. These are called [DVC remotes], and help you to share or back up copies of
your data assets.

DVC remotes are similar to Git remotes, but for <abbr>cached</abbr> data.
