# Cloud Versioning

## Importing versioned data

DVC supports importing cloud-versioned data from supported storage providers.
Refer to `dvc import-url` (`--version-aware`) and `dvc update --rev` for more
information.

## Supported storage providers

Cloud versioning features are only avaible for certain storage providers.
Currently, it is supported on the following storage types:

- [Amazon S3] (requires [S3 Versioning] enabled buckets)
- Microsoft [Azure Blob Storage] (requires [Blob versioning] enabled storage
  accounts and containers)
- [Google Cloud Storage] (requires [Object versioning] enabled buckets)

Lifecycle management policies may delete object versions, in which case DVC will
be unable to recover those versions. For more information about lifecycle
management, see:
