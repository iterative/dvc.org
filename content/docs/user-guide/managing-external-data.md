# Managing External Data

> ⚠️ This is an advanced feature that we don't recommend using unless you really
> know what you are doing. Artifacts added with --external are not affected by
> `dvc push/pull/status -c`. You are likely looking for straight
> [to-cache](/doc/command-reference/add#example-transfer-to-the-cache) or
> [to-remote](/doc/command-reference/add#example-transfer-to-remote-storage)
> transfers, or `dvc import-url`).

There are cases when data is so large, or its processing is organized in such a
way, that its preferable to avoid moving it from its original location. For
example data on a network attached storage (NAS), processing data on HDFS,
running [Dask](https://dask.org/) via SSH, or for a script that streams data
from S3 to process it.

External outputs and
[external dependencies](/doc/user-guide/external-dependencies) provide ways to
track and version data outside of the <abbr>project</abbr>.

## How external outputs work

External <abbr>outputs</abbr> are considered part of the (extended) DVC project:
DVC will track them for
[versioning](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files), detecting when
they change (reported by `dvc status`, for example).

To use existing files or directories in an external location as
[stage](/doc/command-reference/run) outputs, give their remote URLs or external
paths to `dvc add`, or put them in `dvc.yaml` (`deps` field). Use the same
format as the `url` of certain `dvc remote` types. Currently, the following
protocols are supported:

- Amazon S3
- SSH
- HDFS
- Local files and directories outside the <abbr>workspace</abbr>

External outputs require an
[external cache](/doc/use-cases/shared-development-server#configure-the-external-shared-cache)
in the same external/remote file.

> Note that [remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote) is a different
> feature, and that external outputs are not pushed or pulled from/to DVC
> remotes.

> ⚠️ Avoid using the same DVC remote used for `dvc push`, `dvc pull`, etc. for
> external outputs, because it may cause data collisions: the hash of an
> external output could collide with that of a local file with different
> content.

## Examples

Let's take a look at the following operations on all the supported location
types:

1. Adding a `dvc remote` in the same location as the desired outputs, and
   configure it as external <abbr>cache</abbr> with `dvc config`.
2. Tracking existing data on the external location using `dvc add` (`--external`
   option needed). This produces a `.dvc` file with an external URL or path in
   its `outs` field.
3. Creating a simple stage with `dvc run` (`--external` option needed) that
   moves a local file to the external location. This produces an external output
   in `dvc.yaml`.

### Click for Amazon S3

```dvc
$ dvc remote add s3cache s3://mybucket/cache
$ dvc config cache.s3 s3cache

$ dvc add --external s3://mybucket/existing-data

$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          --external \
          -o s3://mybucket/data.txt \
          aws s3 cp data.txt s3://mybucket/data.txt
```

### Click for SSH

```dvc
$ dvc remote add sshcache ssh://user@example.com/cache
$ dvc config cache.ssh sshcache

$ dvc add --external ssh://user@example.com/existing-data

$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          --external \
          -o ssh://user@example.com/data.txt \
          scp data.txt user@example.com:/data.txt
```

> Please note that to use password authentication, it's necessary to set the
> `password` or `ask_password` SSH remote options first (see
> `dvc remote modify`), and use a special `remote://` URL in step 2:
> `dvc add --external remote://sshcache/existing-data`.

⚠️ DVC requires both SSH and SFTP access to work with remote SSH locations.
Please check that you are able to connect both ways with tools like `ssh` and
`sftp` (GNU/Linux).

> Note that your server's SFTP root might differ from its physical root (`/`).

### Click for HDFS

```dvc
$ dvc remote add hdfscache hdfs://user@example.com/cache
$ dvc config cache.hdfs hdfscache

$ dvc add --external hdfs://user@example.com/existing-data

$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          --external \
          -o hdfs://user@example.com/data.txt \
          hdfs fs -copyFromLocal \
                  data.txt \
                  hdfs://user@example.com/data.txt
```

Note that as long as there is a `hdfs://...` URL for your data, DVC can handle
it. So systems like Hadoop, Hive, and HBase are supported!

### Click for WebHDFS

```dvc
$ dvc remote add webhdfscache webhdfs://user@example.com/cache
$ dvc config cache.webhdfs webhdfscache

$ dvc add --external webhdfs://user@example.com/existing-data

$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          --external \
          -o webhdfs://user@example.com/data.txt \
          curl --upload-file data.txt \
              "http://user@example.com:50075/webhdfs/v1/data.txt?op=CREATE"
```

### Click for local file system paths

The default <abbr>cache</abbr> is in `.dvc/cache`, so there is no need to set a
custom cache location for local paths outside of your project.

> Except for external data on different storage devices or partitions mounted on
> the same file system (e.g. `/mnt/raid/data`). In that case please setup an
> external cache in that same drive to enable
> [file links](/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization#file-link-types-for-the-dvc-cache)
> and avoid copying data.

```dvc
$ dvc add --external /home/shared/existing-data

$ dvc run -d data.txt \
          --external \
          -o /home/shared/data.txt \
          cp data.txt /home/shared/data.txt
```
