# DVC Files and Directories

Once initialized in a <abbr>project</abbr>, DVC populates its installation
directory (`.dvc/`) with the internal files and directories needed for DVC
operation:

- `.dvc/config`: This is a configuration file. The config file can be edited by
  hand or with the `dvc config` command.

- `.dvc/config.local`: This is a local configuration file, that will overwrite
  options in `.dvc/config`. This is useful when you need to specify private
  options in your config that you don't want to track and share through Git
  (credentials, private locations, etc). The local config file can be edited by
  hand or with the command `dvc config --local`.

- `.dvc/cache`: The [cache directory](#structure-of-cache-directory) will store
  your data. The data files and directories in the <abbr>workspace</abbr> will
  only contain links to the data files in the cache. (Refer to
  [Large Dataset Optimization](/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization). See
  `dvc config cache` for related configuration options.

  > Note that DVC includes the cache directory in `.gitignore` during
  > initialization. No data tracked by DVC will ever be pushed to the Git
  > repository, only [DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) that are
  > needed to download or reproduce them.

- `.dvc/tmp`: Directory for miscellaneous temporary files

- `.dvc/tmp/index`: Directory for remote index files that are used for
  optimizing `dvc push`, `dvc pull`, `dvc fetch` and `dvc status -c` operations.

- `.dvc/tmp/state`: This file is used for optimization. It is a SQLite database,
  that contains hash values for files tracked in a DVC project, with respective
  timestamps and inodes to avoid unnecessary file hash computations. It also
  contains a list of links (from cache to <abbr>workspace</abbr>) created by DVC
  and is used to cleanup your workspace when calling `dvc checkout`.

- `.dvc/tmp/state-journal`: Temporary file for SQLite operations

- `.dvc/tmp/state-wal`: Another SQLite temporary file

- `.dvc/tmp/updater`: This file is used store the latest available version of
  DVC. It's used to remind the user to upgrade when the installed version is
  behind.

- `.dvc/tmp/updater.lock`: Lock file for `.dvc/tmp/updater`

- `.dvc/tmp/lock`: Lock file for the entire DVC project

- `.dvc/tmp/rwlock`: JSON file that contains read and write locks for specific
  dependencies and outputs, to allow safely running multiple DVC commands in
  parallel.

## Structure of cache directory

There are two ways in which the data is stored in <abbr>cache</abbr>: As a
single file (eg. `data.csv`), or a directory of files.

For the first case, we calculate the file hash, a 32 characters long string
(usually MD5). The first two characters are used to name the directory inside
`.dvc/cache`, and the rest become the file name of the cached file. For example,
if a data file `Posts.xml.zip` has a hash value of
`ec1d2935f811b77cc49b031b999cbf17`, its local cache entry will be
`.dvc/cache/ec/1d2935f811b77cc49b031b999cbf17`.

> Note that file hashes are calculated from file contents only. 2 or more files
> with different names but the same contents can exist in the workspace and be
> tracked by DVC, but only one copy is stored in the cache. This helps avoid
> data duplication in cache and remotes.

For the second case, let us consider a directory with 2 images.

```dvc
$ tree data/images/
data/images/
├── cat.jpeg
└── index.jpeg

$ dvc add data/images
...
```

When running `dvc add` on this directory of images, a `data/images.dvc`
[DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) is created, containing the hash
value of the directory:

```yaml
md5: 77e511dafe2178d936e54331d5d6288f
outs:
  - md5: 196a322c107c2572335158503c64bfba.dir
    path: data/images
    # ...
```

The directory in cache is stored as a JSON metafile describing it's contents,
along with the files it contains in cache, like this:

```dvc
$ tree .dvc/cache
.dvc/cache/
├── 19
│   └── 6a322c107c2572335158503c64bfba.dir
├── d4
│   └── 1d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
└── 20
    └── 0b40427ee0998e9802335d98f08cd98f
```

The cache file with `.dir` extension is a special text file that contains the
mapping of files in the `data/` directory (as a JSON array), along with their
hash values. The other two cache files are the files inside `data/`.

A typical `.dir` cache file looks like this:

```dvc
$ cat .dvc/cache/19/6a322c107c2572335158503c64bfba.dir
[{"md5": "dff70c0392d7d386c39a23c64fcc0376", "relpath": "cat.jpeg"},
{"md5": "29a6c8271c0c8fbf75d3b97aecee589f", "relpath": "index.jpeg"}]
```

See also `dvc cache dir` to set the location of the cache directory.
