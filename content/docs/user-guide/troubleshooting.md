## Failed to pull data from the cloud {#missing-files}

Users may encounter errors when running `dvc pull` and `dvc fetch`, like
`WARNING: Cache 'xxxx' not found.` or
`ERROR: failed to pull data from the cloud`. The most common cause is changes
pushed to Git without the corresponding data being uploaded to the
[DVC remote](/doc/command-reference/remote). Make sure to `dvc push` from the
original <abbr>project</abbr>, and try again.

## Too many open files error {#many-files}

A known problem some users run into with the `dvc pull`, `dvc fetch` and
`dvc push` commands is `[Errno 24] Too many open files` (most common for S3
remotes on macOS). The more `--jobs` specified, the more file descriptors need
to be open on the host file system for each download thread, and the limit may
be reached, causing this error.

To solve this, it's often possible to increase the open file descriptors limit,
with `ulimit` on UNIX-like system (for example `ulimit -n 1024`), or
[increasing Handles limit](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/markrussinovich/2009/09/29/pushing-the-limits-of-windows-handles/)
on Windows. Otherwise, please try using a lower `JOBS` value.

## Unable to find credentials {#no-credentials}

Make sure that you have your AWS credentials setup either through
[usual AWS configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
or by setting `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` with `dvc remote modify`.

## Unable to connect {#connection-error}

Make sure you are online and able to access your
[AWS S3 endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html), or
`endpointurl` if explicitly set with `dvc remote modify`.

## Bucket does not exist {#no-bucket}

Make sure your bucket
[exists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html)
in the correct `region` and/or `endpointurl` (see `dvc remote modify`).

## Unable to detect cache type {#no-dvc-cache}

Unable to detect supported link types, as the
[cache directory](/doc/command-reference/config#cache) doesn't exist. It is
usually created automatically by DVC commands that need it, but you can create
it manually (e.g. `mkdir .dvc/cache`) to enable this check.

## Unable to acquire lock {#lock-issue}

You may encounter an error message saying `Unable to acquire lock` if you have
another DVC process running in the project. If that is not the case, it usually
means that DVC was terminated abruptly and manually removing the lock file in
`.dvc/tmp/lock` should resolve the issue.

If the issue still persists then it may be the case that you are running DVC on
some network filesystem like NFS, Lustre, etc. If so, the solution is to enable
`core.hardlink_lock` which can be done by running following command:

```dvc
$ dvc config core.hardlink_lock true
```

## Cannot add files in symlinked directory {#add-symlink}

DVC only supports [symlinked files](/doc/command-reference/add#add-symlink) as
valid targets for `dvc add`. If the target path is a directory symlink, or if
the target path contains any intermediate directory symlinks, `dvc add` will
fail.

## No possible cache types {#cache-types}

You may encounter this error if DVC cannot find a valid
[file link type](/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization#file-link-types-for-the-dvc-cache)
to use when linking data files from cache into your workspace. To resolve the
issue, you may need to
[reconfigure](/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization#configuring-dvc-cache-file-link-type)
DVC to use alternative link types which are supported on your machine.

After reconfiguring cache types, you can re-link data files in your workspace
using:

```dvc
$ dvc checkout --relink
```

## HTTP Git authentication is not supported {#git-auth}

[Experiment sharing](/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/sharing-experiments)
commands accept a `git_remote` argument. In order to access the Git remote, you
may need to authenticate for _write_ (`dvc exp push`) or _read_ (`dvc exp list`,
`dvc exp pull`) permissions.

DVC does not currently support authentication with [Git credentials]. This means
that unless the Git server allows unauthenticated HTTP write/read, you should
use an [SSH Git URL] when listing, pulling or pushing experiments.
