# What Is DVC?

**Data Version Control** is a new type of data versioning, workflow, and
experiment management software, that builds upon [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
(although it can work stand-alone). DVC reduces the gap between established
engineering tool sets and data science needs, allowing users to take advantage
of new [features](#core-features) while reusing existing skills and intuition.

Data science experiment sharing and collaboration can be done through a regular
Git flow (commits, branching, pull requests, etc.), the same way it works for
software engineers. Using Git and DVC, data science and machine learning teams
can version experiments, manage large datasets, and make projects reproducible.

## Core Features

- DVC is a [free](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/blob/master/LICENSE),
  open-source [command line](/doc/command-reference) tool.

- DVC works **on top of Git repositories** and has a similar command line
  interface and flow as Git. DVC can also work stand-alone, but without
  [versioning](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files) capabilities.

- **Data versioning** is enabled by replacing large files, dataset directories,
  machine learning models, etc. with small
  [metafiles](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories) (easy to handle with
  Git). These placeholders point to the original data, which is decoupled from
  source code management.

- **Data storage**: On-premises or cloud storage can be used to store the
  project's data separate from its code base. This is how data scientists can
  transfer large datasets or share a GPU-trained model with others.

- DVC makes data science projects **reproducible** by creating lightweight
  [pipelines](/doc/command-reference/dag) using implicit dependency graphs, and
  by codifying the data and artifacts involved.

- DVC is **platform agnostic**: It runs on all major operating systems (Linux,
  MacOS, and Windows), and works independently of the programming languages
  (Python, R, Julia, shell scripts, etc.) or ML libraries (Keras, Tensorflow,
  PyTorch, Scipy, etc.) used in the <abbr>project</abbr>.

- **Easy to use**: DVC is quick to [install](/doc/install) and doesn't require
  special infrastructure, nor does it depend on APIs or external services. It's
  a stand-alone CLI tool.
