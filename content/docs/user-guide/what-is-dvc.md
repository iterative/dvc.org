# What Is DVC?

**Data Version Control** is a new type of data versioning, workflow, and
[experiment management](/doc/user-guide/experiment-management) software, that
builds upon [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (although it can work stand-alone). DVC
reduces the gap between established engineering toolsets and data science needs,
allowing users to take advantage of new [features](#core-features) while reusing
existing skills and intuition.

Data science experiment sharing and collaboration can be done through a regular
Git flow (commits, branching, pull requests, etc.), the same way it works for
software engineers. Using Git and DVC, data science and machine learning teams
can version experiments, manage large datasets, and make projects reproducible.

## Core Features

- DVC is a [free], open-source [VS Code Extension] and [command line] tool.

- DVC works **on top of Git repositories** and has a similar command line
  interface and flow as Git. DVC can also work stand-alone, but without
  [versioning](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files) capabilities.

- **Data versioning** is enabled by replacing large files, dataset directories,
  machine learning models, etc. with small
  [metafiles](/doc/user-guide/project-structure) (easy to handle with Git).
  These placeholders point to the original data, which is decoupled from source
  code management.

- **Data storage**: On-premises or cloud storage can be used to store the
  project's data separate from its code base. This is how data scientists can
  transfer large datasets or share a GPU-trained model with others.

- DVC makes data science projects **reproducible** by creating lightweight
  [pipelines](/doc/command-reference/dag) using implicit dependency graphs, and
  by codifying the data and artifacts involved.

- DVC is **platform agnostic**: It runs on all major operating systems (Linux,
  macOS, and Windows), and works independently of the programming languages
  (Python, R, Julia, shell scripts, etc.) or ML libraries (Keras, Tensorflow,
  PyTorch, Scipy, etc.) used in the <abbr>project</abbr>.

- **Easy to use**: DVC is quick to [install](/doc/install) and doesn't require
  special infrastructure, nor does it depend on APIs or external services. It's
  a stand-alone CLI tool.

## DVC does not replace Git!

DVC files such as `dvc.yaml` and `.dvc` files serve as placeholders to track
large data files and directories for versioning (among other
[purposes](/doc/user-guide/project-structure)). These metafiles change along
with your data, and you can use Git to place them under
[version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
as a proxy to the actual data versions, which are stored in the <abbr>DVC
cache</abbr> (outside of Git). This does not replace features of Git.

DVC does, however, provide several commands similar to Git such as `dvc init`,
`dvc add`, `dvc checkout`, or `dvc push`, which interact with the underlying Git
repo (if one is being used, which is not required).
