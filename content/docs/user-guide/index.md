# User Guide

This section describes the main DVC concepts and features comprehensively,
explaining when and how to use them, as well as connections between them. These
guides don't focus on specific scenarios, but have a general scope – like a user
manual. Their topics range from more technical foundations, impacting more parts
of DVC, to more advanced and specific things you can do. We also include a few
guides related to contributing to this
[open-source project](https://github.com/iterative/dvc).
