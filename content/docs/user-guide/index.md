# User Guide

Our guides describe the major concepts in DVC and how it works comprehensively,
explaining when and how to use what, as well as inter-relationship between them.

The topics here range from more foundational (impacting many parts of DVC) to
more specific and advanced things you can do. We also include a few misc.
guides, for example related to
[contributing to DVC](/doc/user-guide/contributing/core) itself.
