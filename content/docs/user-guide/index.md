# User Guide

Our guides describe the major features and concepts of DVC comprehensively,
explaining when and how to use them, as well as relationship between these. We
don't focus on specific scenarios in this section, but rather on a general
scope. The topics here range from more foundational, impacting more parts of
DVC, to more technical and advanced things you can do. We also include a few
misc. guides, for example related to
[contributing to DVC](/doc/user-guide/contributing/core) itself.
