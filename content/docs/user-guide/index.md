# User Guide

Data Version Control, or DVC, is **a new type of experiment management
software** that has been built **on top of the existing engineering toolset that
you're already used to**, and particularly on a source code version control
system (currently Git). DVC reduces the gap between existing tools and data
science needs, allowing users to take advantage of experiment management
software while reusing existing skills and intuition.

The underlying source code control system eliminates the need to use external
services. Data science experiment sharing and collaboration can be done through
regular Git tools (commit messages, merges, pull requests, etc) the same way it
works for software engineers.

DVC implements a **Git experimentation methodology** where each experiment
exists with its code as well as data, and can be represented as a separate Git
branch or commit.

Our guides describe the main DVC concepts and features comprehensively,
explaining when and how to use them, as well as connections between them. These
guides don't focus on specific scenarios, but have a general scope – like a user
manual. Their topics range from more technical foundations, impacting more parts
of DVC, to more advanced and specific things you can do. We also include a few
guides related to contributing to
[this open-source project](https://github.com/iterative/dvc).
