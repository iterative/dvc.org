# User Guide

Our guides describe the main DVC concepts and features comprehensively,
explaining when and how to use them, as well as connections between them. These
guides don't focus on specific scenarios, but have a general scope – like a user
manual. Their topics range from more technical foundations, impacting more parts
of DVC, to more advanced and specific things you can do. 

Being an open-source and a self-serve projects, we would appreciate it if you 
consider contributing to [the project](https://github.com/iterative/dvc). We also 
have a few guides to help you get started with the same.
