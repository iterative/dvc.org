# DVC Project

A DVC project (or DVC repository) is a directory initialized by `dvc init`. It
contains [`.dvc` directory](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/internal-files),
`dvc.yaml` files possible in multiple directories that describes
<abbr>pipelines</abbr> and `.dvc` files for each tracked data file. `dvc root`
returns the root of DVC project.

Although it can used without a standard VCS or with alternative VCS's, a DVC
project _usually_ has a `.git` directory along with a `.dvc` directory.

When we talk about DVC project apart from <abbr>workspace</abbr>, we mean all
artifacts of the project including those in <abbr>remotes</abbr> and
<abbr>cache</abbr>.
