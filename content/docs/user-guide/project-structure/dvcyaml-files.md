# `dvc.yaml`

You can construct data science or machine learning pipelines by defining
individual [stages](/doc/command-reference/run) in one or more `dvc.yaml` files.
Stages form a pipeline when they connect with each other (forming a _dependency
graph_, see `dvc dag`). Refer to
[Get Started: Data Pipelines](/doc/start/data-pipelines).

<admon type="tip">

A helper command, `dvc stage`, is available to create and list stages.

</admon>

`dvc.yaml` files can be versioned with Git.

These files use the [YAML 1.2](https://yaml.org/) file format, and a
human-friendly schema explained below. We encourage you to get familiar with it
so you may modify, write, or generate stages and pipelines on your own.

<admon type="info">

We use [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/software/software.html) in most of our
examples.

</admon>

## Stages

The list of `stages` contains one or more user-defined stages. Here's a simple
one named `transpose`:

```yaml
stages:
  transpose:
    cmd: ./trans.r rows.txt > columns.txt
    deps:
      - rows.txt
    outs:
      - columns.txt
```

> See also `dvc stage add`, a helper command to write stages in `dvc.yaml`.

The most important part of a stage is the terminal command(s) it executes (`cmd`
field). This is what DVC runs when the stage is reproduced (see `dvc repro`).

If a command reads input files, these (or their directory locations) can be
defined as <abbr>dependencies</abbr> (`deps`). DVC will check whether they have
changed to decide whether the stage requires re-execution (see `dvc status`).

If it writes files or dirs, they can be defined as <abbr>outputs</abbr>
(`outs`). DVC will track them going forward (similar to using `dvc add`).

<admon type="tip">

Output files may be viable data sources for [top-level plots].

<admon type="info">

See the full stage entry [specification](#stage-entries).

</admon>

### Parameter dependencies

[Parameters](/doc/command-reference/params) are a special type of stage
dependency. They consist of a list of params to track in one of these formats:

1. A param key/value pair that can be found in `params.yaml` (default params
   file);
2. A dictionary named by the file path to a custom params file, and with a list
   of param key/value pairs to find in it;
3. An empty set (give no value or use `null`) named by the file path to a params
   file: to track all the params in it dynamically.

<admon type="info">

Note that file paths used must be to valid YAML, JSON, TOML, or Python
parameters file.

</admon>

```yaml
stages:
  preprocess:
    cmd: bin/cleanup raw.txt clean.txt
    deps:
      - raw.txt
    params:
      - threshold # track specific param (from params.yaml)
      - passes
      - myparams.yaml: # track specific params from custom file
          - epochs
      - config.json: # track all parameters in this file
    outs:
      - clean.txt
```

This allows several stages to depend on values of a shared structured file
(which can be versioned directly with Git). See also `dvc params diff`.

### Metrics and Plots outputs

Like [common outputs](#outputs), <abbr>metrics</abbr> and <abbr>plots</abbr>
files are produced by the stage `cmd`. However, their purpose is different.
Typically they contain metadata to evaluate pipeline processes. Example:

```yaml
stages:
  build:
    cmd: python train.py
    deps:
      - features.csv
    outs:
      - model.pt
    metrics:
      - accuracy.txt:
          cache: false
    plots:
      - auc.json:
          cache: false
```

> `cache: false` is typical here, since they're small enough for Git to version
> directly.

The commands in `dvc metrics` and `dvc plots` help you display and compare
metrics and plots.

## Templating

_New in DVC 2.0 (see `dvc version`)_

`dvc.yaml` supports a templating format to insert values from different sources
in the YAML structure itself. These sources can be
[parameters files](/doc/command-reference/params), or `vars` defined in
`dvc.yaml` instead.

Let's say we have `params.yaml` (default params file) with the following
contents:

```yaml
models:
  us:
    threshold: 10
    filename: 'model-us.hdf5'
```

Those values can be used anywhere in `dvc.yaml` with the `${}` _substitution
expression_:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```yaml
stages:
  build-us:
    cmd: >-
      python train.py
      --thresh ${models.us.threshold}
      --out ${models.us.filename}
    outs:
      - ${models.us.filename}:
          cache: true
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

DVC will track simple param values (numbers, strings, etc.) used in `${}` (they
will be listed by `dvc params diff`).

### Dict Unpacking

Only inside the `cmd` entries, you can also reference a dictionary inside `${}`
and DVC will _unpack_ it. For example, given the following `params.yaml`:

```yaml
dict:
  foo: foo
  bar: 2
  bool: true
  nested:
    foo: bar
  list: [1, 2, 'foo']
```

You can reference `dict` in the `cmd` section of a `dvc.yaml`:

```yaml
stages:
  train:
    cmd: python train.py ${dict}
```

And DVC will _unpack_ the values inside `dict`, creating the following `cmd`
call:

```cli
$ python train.py --foo 'foo' --bar 2 --bool \
                  --nested.foo 'bar' --list 1 2 'foo'
```

This can be useful for avoiding to write every argument passed to the `cmd` or
having to modify the `dvc.yaml` when adding or removing arguments.

<admon type="tip">

The [parsing](/doc/command-reference/config#parsing) section of `dvc config` can
be used to customize the syntax used for some ambiguous types like booleans and
lists.

</admon>

### Vars

Alternatively, values for substitution can be listed as top-level `vars` like
this:

```yaml
vars:
  - models:
      us:
        threshold: 10
  - desc: 'Reusable description'

stages:
  build-us:
    desc: ${desc}
    cmd: python train.py --thresh ${models.us.threshold}
```

<admon type="warn">

Values from `vars` are not tracked like parameters.

</admon>

To load additional params files, list them in the top `vars`, in the desired
order, e.g.:

> Params file paths will be evaluated based on [`wdir`](#stage-entries), if
> specified.

```yaml
vars:
  - params.json
  - myvar: 'value'
  - config/myapp.yaml
```

<admon type="info">

Note that the default `params.yaml` file is always loaded first, if present.

</admon>

It's also possible to specify what to include from additional params files, with
a `:` colon:

```yaml
vars:
  - params.json:clean,feats

stages:
  featurize:
    cmd: ${feats.exec}
    deps:
      - ${clean.filename}
    outs:
      - ${feats.dirname}
```

Stage-specific values are also supported, with inner `vars`. You may also load
additional params files locally. For example:

```yaml
stages:
  build-us:
    vars:
      - params.json:build
      - model:
          filename: 'model-us.hdf5'
    cmd: python train.py ${build.epochs} --out ${model.filename}
    outs:
      - ${model.filename}
```

DVC merges values from params files and `vars` in each scope when possible. For
example, `{"grp": {"a": 1}}` merges with `{"grp": {"b": 2}}`, but not with
`{"grp": {"a": 7}}`.

⚠️ Known limitations of local `vars`:

- [`wdir`](#stage-entries) cannot use values from local `vars`, as DVC uses the
  working directory first (to load any values from params files listed in
  `vars`).
- `foreach` is also incompatible with local `vars` at the moment.

The substitution expression supports these forms:

```yaml
${param} # Simple
${param.key} # Nested values through . (period)
${param.list[0]} # List elements via index in [] (square brackets)
```

> To use the expression literally in `dvc.yaml` (so DVC does not replace it for
> a value), escape it with a backslash, e.g. `\${...`.

## `foreach` stages

_New in DVC 2.0 (see `dvc version`)_

You can define more than one stage in a single `dvc.yaml` entry with the
following syntax. A `foreach` element accepts a list or dictionary with values
to iterate on, while `do` contains the regular stage fields (`cmd`, `outs`,
etc.). Here's a simple example:

```yaml
stages:
  cleanups:
    foreach: # List of simple values
      - raw1
      - labels1
      - raw2
    do:
      cmd: clean.py "${item}"
      outs:
        - ${item}.cln
```

Upon `dvc repro`, each item in the list is expanded into its own stage by
substituting its value in expression `${item}`. The item's value is appended to
each stage name after a `@`. The final stages generated by the `foreach` syntax
are saved to `dvc.lock`:

```yaml
schema: '2.0'
stages:
  cleanups@labels1:
    cmd: clean.py "labels1"
    outs:
      - path: labels1.cln
  cleanups@raw1:
    cmd: clean.py "raw1"
    outs:
      - path: raw1.cln
  cleanups@raw2:
    cmd: clean.py "raw2"
    outs:
      - path: raw2.cln
```

For lists containing complex values (e.g. dictionaries), the substitution
expression can use the `${item.key}` form. Stage names will be appended with a
zero-based index. For example:

```yaml
stages:
  train:
    foreach:
      - epochs: 3
        thresh: 10
      - epochs: 10
        thresh: 15
    do:
      cmd: python train.py ${item.epochs} ${item.thresh}
```

```yaml
# dvc.lock
schema: '2.0'
stages:
  train@0:
    cmd: python train.py 3 10
  train@1:
    cmd: python train.py 10 15
```

DVC can also iterate on a dictionary given directly to `foreach`, resulting in
two substitution expressions being available: `${key}` and `${item}`. The former
is used for the stage names:

```yaml
stages:
  build:
    foreach:
      uk:
        epochs: 3
        thresh: 10
      us:
        epochs: 10
        thresh: 15
    do:
      cmd: python train.py '${key}' ${item.epochs} ${item.thresh}
      outs:
        - model-${key}.hdfs
```

```yaml
# dvc.lock
schema: '2.0'
stages:
  build@uk:
    cmd: python train.py 'uk' 3 10
    outs:
      - path: model-uk.hdfs
        md5: 17b3d1efc339b416c4b5615b1ce1b97e
  build@us: ...
```

Importantly, dictionaries from
[parameters files](/doc/command-reference/params#examples) can be used in
`foreach` stages as well:

```yaml
stages:
  mystages:
    foreach: ${myobject} # From params.yaml
    do:
      cmd: ./script.py ${key} ${item.prop1}
      outs:
        - ${item.prop2}
```

> Note that this feature is not compatible with [templating](#templating) at the
> moment.

## Stage entries

These are the fields that are accepted in each stage:

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cmd`            | (Required) One or more commands executed by the stage (may contain either a single value or a list). Commands are executed sequentially until all are finished or until one of them fails (see `dvc repro`).                                                                              |
| `wdir`           | Working directory for the stage command to run in (relative to the file's location). Any paths in other fields are also based on this. It defaults to `.` (the file's location).                                                                                                          |
| `deps`           | List of <abbr>dependency</abbr> paths of this stage (relative to `wdir`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `outs`           | List of stage <abbr>output</abbr> paths (relative to `wdir`). These can contain optional [subfields](#output-subfields).                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `params`         | List of <abbr>parameter</abbr> dependency keys (field names) to track from `params.yaml` (in `wdir`). The list may also contain other parameters file names, with a sub-list of the param names to track in them.                                                                         |
| `metrics`        | List of [metrics files](/doc/command-reference/metrics), and optionally, whether or not this metrics file is <abbr>cached</abbr> (`true` by default). See the `--metrics-no-cache` (`-M`) option of `dvc run`.                                                                            |
| `plots`          | List of [plot metrics](/doc/command-reference/plots), and optionally, their default configuration (subfields matching the options of `dvc plots modify`), and whether or not this plots file is <abbr>cached</abbr> ( `true` by default). See the `--plots-no-cache` option of `dvc run`. |
| `frozen`         | Whether or not this stage is frozen from reproduction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `always_changed` | Causes this stage to be always considered as [changed] by commands such as `dvc status` and `dvc repro`. `false` by default                                                                                                                                                               |
| `meta`           | (Optional) arbitrary metadata can be added manually with this field. Any YAML content is supported. `meta` contents are ignored by DVC, but they can be meaningful for user processes that read or write `.dvc` files directly.                                                           |
| `desc`           | (Optional) user description for this stage. This doesn't affect any DVC operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

`dvc.yaml` files also support `# comments`.

Note that we maintain a `dvc.yaml`
[schema](https://github.com/iterative/dvcyaml-schema) that can be used by
editors like [VSCode](/doc/install/plugins#visual-studio-code) or
[PyCharm](/doc/install/plugins#pycharmintellij) to enable automatic syntax
validation and auto-completion.

### Output subfields

> These include a subset of the fields in `.dvc` file
> [output entries](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/dvc-files#output-entries).

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cache`      | Whether or not this file or directory is <abbr>cached</abbr> (`true` by default). See the `--no-commit` option of `dvc add`.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `remote`     | (Optional) Name of the remote to use for pushing/fetching                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `persist`    | Whether the output file/dir should remain in place during `dvc repro` (`false` by default: outputs are deleted when `dvc repro` starts)                                                                                                                                           |
| `checkpoint` | (Optional) Set to `true` to let DVC know that this output is associated with [checkpoint experiments](/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/checkpoints). These outputs are reverted to their last cached version at `dvc exp run` and also `persist` during the stage execution. |
| `desc`       | (Optional) User description for this output. This doesn't affect any DVC operations.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

⚠️ Note that using the `checkpoint` field in `dvc.yaml` is not compatible with
`dvc repro`.

## Top-level plot definitions

The list of `plots` contains one or more user-defined `dvc plots` (paths
relative to the location of `dvc.yaml`).

This example makes output `auc.json` viable for visualization, configuring keys
`fpr` and `tpr` as X and Y axis, respectively:

```yaml
stages:
  build:
    cmd: python train.py
    deps:
      - features.csv
    outs:
      - model.pt
      - auc.json
    metrics:
      - accuracy.txt:
          cache: false
plots:
  auc.json:
    x: fpr
    y: tpr
```

Note that we didn't have to specify `auc.json` as a [plot output] in the stage.
In fact, [top-level plots] can use any file found in the <abbr>project</abbr>.

[plot output]: /doc/command-reference/plots#stage-plots

## dvc.lock file

> ⚠️ Avoid editing these files. DVC will create and update them for you.

To record the state of your pipeline(s) and help track its <abbr>outputs</abbr>,
DVC will maintain a `dvc.lock` file for each `dvc.yaml`. Their purposes include:

- Allow DVC to detect when stage definitions, or their <abbr>dependencies</abbr>
  have changed. Such conditions invalidate stages, requiring their reproduction
  (see `dvc status`).
- Tracking of intermediate and final outputs of a pipeline — similar to `.dvc`
  files.
- Needed for several DVC commands to operate, such as `dvc checkout` or
  `dvc get`.

Here's an example:

```yaml
schema: '2.0'
stages:
  features:
    cmd: jupyter nbconvert --execute featurize.ipynb
    deps:
      - path: data/clean
        md5: d8b874c5fa18c32b2d67f73606a1be60
    params:
      params.yaml:
        levels.no: 5

Stages are listed again in `dvc.lock`, in order to know if their definitions
change in `dvc.yaml`.

Regular
[dependency entries](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/dvc-files#dependency-entries)
and all forms of
[output entries](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/dvc-files#output-entries)
(including [metrics](/doc/command-reference/metrics) and
[plots](/doc/command-reference/plots) files) are also listed (per stage) in
`dvc.lock`, including a content hash field (`md5`, `etag`, or `checksum`).

Full <abbr>parameter dependencies</abbr> (both key and value) are listed too
(under `params`), under each parameters file name.
[templated `dvc.yaml`](#templating) files, the actual values are written to
`dvc.lock` (no `${}` expression). As for [`foreach` stages](#foreach-stages),
individual stages are expanded (no `foreach` structures are preserved).
