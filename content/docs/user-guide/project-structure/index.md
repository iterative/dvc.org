# Project Structure

Using `dvc init` in your <abbr>workspace</abbr> will initialize a <abbr>DVC
project</abbr>, including the internal `.dvc/` directory. From there on, you
will create and manage different DVC metafiles (below), and populate the
<abbr>cache</abbr> with data artifacts as you work on your ML experiments.

- `dvc.yaml` files define stages that form the pipeline(s) of a project. All
  stage-based features such as `dvc params`, `dvc metrics`, and `dvc plots` are
  specified here.

- `.dvc` files ("dot DVC files") are placeholders to track data files and
  directories.

- `.dvcignore` files (optional) contain a list of paths for DVC to ignore, which
  can dramatically increase its operational performance.

- Internal files and directories in `.dvc/` contains the local
  [configuration](/doc/command-reference/config) file(s), default local cache
  location, and other utilities that DVC needs to operate.

These metafiles are typically versioned with Git, as DVC does not replace its
distributed version control features, but rather extends on them.
