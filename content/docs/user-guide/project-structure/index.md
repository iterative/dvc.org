# Project Structure

Using `dvc init` in your <abbr>workspace</abbr> will initialize a <abbr>DVC
project</abbr>, including the internal `.dvc/` directory. From there on, you
will create and manage different DVC metafiles (below), and populate the
<abbr>cache</abbr> with data artifacts as you work on your ML experiments.

- `dvc.yaml` files define stages, parameters, metrics, and plots. Stages form
  the pipeline(s) of a project. Parameters, metrics, and plots are used to
  evaluate and compare project versions and may be defined within stages or
  independently.

- `.dvc` files ("dot DVC files") are placeholders to track data files and
  directories.

- `.dvcignore` files (optional) contain a list of paths for DVC to ignore, which
  can dramatically increase its operational performance.

- Internal files and directories in `.dvc/` contain the local [configuration]
  file(s), default local cache location, and other utilities that DVC needs to
  operate.

These metafiles are typically versioned with Git, as DVC does not replace its
distributed version control features, but rather extends on them.
