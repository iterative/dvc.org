# DVC Experiments Overview

DVC Experiments are captures automatically by DVC when you [run them]. Each
experiment creates and tracks a project variation based on the changes in your
<abbr>workspace</abbr>. Experiments preserve the latest commit in the current
branch (Git `HEAD`) as their parent or _baseline_, but do not form part of the
regular Git tree or workflow (unless you make them [persistent]).

### ‚öôÔ∏è How does DVC track experiments?

Experiments are custom [Git references] (found in `.git/refs/exps`) with a
single commit based on `HEAD` (not checked out by DVC). Note that these commits
are not pushed to Git remotes by default (see `dvc exp push`).

## Properties

DVC Experiments will have an auto-generated name like `exp-bfe64` by default. A
custom name can be given instead (using the `--name`/`-n` option of
`dvc exp run`). These names can be used to reference experiments in other
`dvc exp` subcommands.

All experiments created by DVC will be associated to the latest commit (Git
`HEAD`) at the time that they were run. This is called the experiment's
_baseline_.

## Basic workflow

`dvc exp` commands let you automatically track a variation to a committed
project version (baseline). You can create independent groups of experiments
this way, as well as review, compare, and restore them later. The basic workflow
goes like this:

- Modify hyperparameters or other dependencies (input data, source code,
  commands to execute, etc.). Leave these changes un-committed in Git.
- [Run experiments] with `dvc exp run` (instead of `repro`). The results are
  reflected in your <abbr>workspace</abbr>, and tracked automatically.
- Review and [compare] experiments with `dvc exp show` or `dvc exp diff`, using
  [metrics](/doc/command-reference/metrics) to identify the best one(s). Repeat
  üîÑ
- Make certain experiments [persistent] by committing their results to Git. This
  lets you repeat the process from that point.
