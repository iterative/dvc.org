# DVC Experiments Overview

`dvc exp` commands let you automatically track a variation to a committed
project version (baseline). You can create independent groups of experiments
this way, as well as review, compare, and restore them later. The basic workflow
goes like this:

- Modify <abbr>parameters</abbr> or other dependencies (input data, source code,
  stage definitions, etc.) of committed stages.
- [Run experiments] with `dvc exp run` (instead of `repro`) to execute the
  pipeline. The results are reflected in your <abbr>workspace</abbr>, and
  tracked automatically.
- Use [metrics](/doc/command-reference/metrics) to identify the best
  experiment(s).
- Visualize and compare experiments with `dvc exp show` or `dvc exp diff`.
  Repeat ðŸ”„
- Make certain experiments [persistent] by committing their results to Git. This
  cleans the slate so you can repeat the process later.
