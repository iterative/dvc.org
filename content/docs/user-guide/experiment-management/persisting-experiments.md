# Persisting Experiments

DVC Experiments run outside of the regular Git workflow for faster iteration and
to avoid polluting your <abbr>repository</abbr>'s history. Once experiments are
good enough to keep or distribute, you may want to store them persistently as
Git commits.

## Create a Git branch from an experiment

You can use `dvc exp branch` to create a new branch from an experiment, and keep
all its code and artifacts separate from your current <abbr>workspace</abbr>.

```cli
$ dvc exp show
```

```dvctable
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  neutral:**Experiment**              neutral:**Created**            metric:**auc**   param:**my_param**
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  workspace               -              0.61314   3
  new-experiments         Oct 19, 2020   0.61314   3
  ├── ochre-dook          Oct 20, 2020   0.69830   2
  └── matte-vies          Oct 22, 2020   0.51676   1
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Suppose you want to continue to work on `ochre-dook` in a separate branch. You
can create a new Git branch by specifying the experiment and giving a new name
for it:

```cli
$ dvc exp branch ochre-dook
Git branch 'ochre-dook-branch' has been created from experiment 'ochre-dook'.
```

Note that DVC doesn't switch to the new branch. You can create one or more
branches from the existing experiments, and switch into any one manually like
this:

```cli
$ git checkout ochre-dook-branch
$ dvc checkout
```

Your workspace now contains all the files from the experiment.

## Bring experiment results to your workspace

Typically, `dvc exp run` and `dvc exp save` leave the experiment results in your
workspace for convenience. However, you may have run multiple experiments and
wish to go back to a specific one. In this case, you can restore a previous
experiment's results with `dvc exp apply`. Let's see an example:

```cli
$ dvc exp show
```

```dvctable
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  neutral:**Experiment**               neutral:**Created**            metric:**auc**   param:**my_param**
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  workspace                -              0.61314   3
  new-experiments          Oct 19, 2020   0.61314   3
  ├── ochre-dook           Oct 20, 2020   0.69830   2
  └── matte-vies           Oct 22, 2020   0.51676   1
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

The results found in the workspace are shown in the respective row. When you
want to bring another experiment to the workspace, you can reference it using
it's name, e.g.:

```cli
$ dvc exp apply ochre-dook
Changes for experiment 'ochre-dook' have been applied...
```

⚠️ Conflicting changes in the workspace are overwritten unless `--no-force` is
used.

> Note that `dvc exp apply` requires your project version (Git `HEAD`) to be the
> same as when the experiment was run.

Now, if you list the experiments again with `dvc exp show`, you'll see that the
workspace contains the results of `ochre-dook`.

You can use standard Git commands (e.g. `git add/commit/push`) to version this
experiment directly in the <abbr>repository</abbr>. DVC-tracked data and
artifacts are already in the DVC cache, and the rest (params, code and config
files, etc.) can be stored in Git.

> Note that you need to `dvc push` in order to share or backup the DVC cache
> contents.
