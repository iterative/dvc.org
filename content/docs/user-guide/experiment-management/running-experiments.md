# Running Experiments

We explain how to execute DVC Experiments, setting their parameters, using
multiple jobs to run them in parallel, and running them in queues, among other
details.

## Pipelines files

DVC relies on `dvc.yaml` files that contain the commands to run the
experiment(s). These files codify _pipelines_ that specify the
<abbr>stages</abbr> of experiment workflows (code, <abbr>parameters</abbr>,
<abbr>outputs</abbr>, etc.).

> üìñ See [Get Started: Data Pipelines](/doc/start/data-pipelines) for an intro
> to this topic.

### Running the pipeline(s)

You can run the pipeline using `dvc exp run`. It uses `./dvc.yaml` (in the
current directory) by default:

```dvc
$ dvc exp run
...
Reproduced experiment(s): exp-44136
```

DVC keeps track of the [dependency graph] among stages. It only runs the ones
with changed dependencies or outputs missing from the <abbr>cache</abbr>. You
can limit this to certain [reproduction targets] or even single stages
(`--single-item` flag).

<abbr>DVC projects</abbr> actually supports more than one pipeline, in one or
more `dvc.yaml` files. The `--all-pipelines` option lets you run them all at
once.

> üìñ `dvc exp run` is an experiment-specific alternative to `dvc repro` where
> you can learn more about these and other pipeline-related options.

## Experiment results

The results of the last `dvc exp run` can be seen in the <abbr>workspace</abbr>.
They are stored and tracked internally by DVC.

To display and compare multiple experiments, use `dvc exp show` or
`dvc exp diff`. `plots diff` also accepts experiments as `revisions`. See
[Reviewing and Comparing Experiments][reviewing] for more details.

Use `dvc exp apply` to restore the results of any other experiment instead. See
[Bring experiment results to your workspace][apply] for more info.

## (Hyper)parameters

ML <abbr>parameters</abbr> are the values that modify the underlying code's
behavior, producing different experiment results. Machine learning
experimentation, for example, involves searching hyperparameters that improve
the resulting model metrics.

In DVC projects, parameters should be read by the code from _parameter files_
(`params.yaml` by default). DVC parses these files to track individual param
values. When a tracked param is changed, `dvc exp run` invalidates any stages
that depend on it, and reruns the experiment.

> Parameters can be defined in `dvc.yaml` directly or through `dvc stage add`.  
> üìñ See `dvc params` for more details.

For a params file named `params.yaml` with the contents

```yaml
model:
  learning_rate: 0.0001
```

You can specify the parameter dependency as

```dvc
$ dvc stage add -n train \
                --parameter model.learning_rate \
                --outs ...
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è DVC does not check whether the parameters are actually used in your code.

<details>

#### Non-default parameter files

DVC allows param files in YAML 1.2, JSON, TOML, and Python formats. When your
parameters file is named something other than `params.yaml`, you need to specify
it in both stage description and `dvc exp run`. For example using
`myparams.toml`:

```dvc
$ dvc stage add -n train \
                -p myparams.toml:learning_rate \
                ...

$ dvc exp run -S myparams.toml:learning_rate = 0.0001
```

</details>

### Updating experiment parameters on-the-fly

You could manually edit a params file and run an experiment on that basis. Since
this is a common sequence, the built-in option `dvc exp run --set-param` (`-S`)
is provided as a shortcut. It takes an existing param name and its value, and
updates the file before the run for you.

```dvc
$ cat params.yaml
model:
  learning_rate: 0.001

$ dvc exp run --set-param model.learning_rate=0.0002
...
```

> Note that parameters are attached to experiments so they're shown together
> when [reviewing] them (e.g. in `dvc exp show`).

To set more than one param for the same experiment, use the `-S` option multiple
times:

```dvc
$ dvc exp run -S learning_rate=0.001 -S units=128
```

## The experiments queue

The `--queue` option of `dvc exp run` tells DVC to append an experiment for
later execution. Nothing is actually run yet.

```dvc
$ dvc exp run --queue -S units=10
Queued experiment '1cac8ca' for future execution.
$ dvc exp run --queue -S units=64
Queued experiment '23660bb' for future execution.
$ dvc exp run --queue -S units=128
Queued experiment '3591a5c' for future execution.
$ dvc exp run --queue -S units=256
Queued experiment '4109ead' for future execution.
```

<details>

### How are experiments queued?

Queued experiments are created similar to
[Git stash](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-stash). The last experiment queued
is found in `.git/refs/exps`, and earlier ones are in its [reflog].

[reflog]:
  https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefreflogareflog

</details>

Each experiment is derived from the <abbr>workspace</abbr> at the time it's
queued. If you make changes in the workspace afterwards, they won't be reflected
in queued experiments (once run).

Run them all one-by-one with the `--run-all` flag. For isolation, this is done
outside your <abbr>workspace</abbr> (in temporary directories).

> Note that the order of execution is independent of their creation order.

```dvc
$ dvc exp run --run-all
```

<details>

### How are queued experiments isolated?

DVC creates a copy of the experiment's original workspace in `.dvc/tmp/exps/`
and runs it there. All workspaces share the single project <abbr>cache</abbr>,
however.

üí° To isolate any experiment (without queuing it), you can use the `--temp`
flag. This allows you to continue working while a long experiment runs, e.g.:

```dvc
$ nohup dvc exp run --temp &
[1] 30473
nohup: ignoring input and appending output to 'nohup.out'
```

Note that Git-ignored files/dirs are excluded from queued/temp runs to avoid
committing unwanted files into Git (e.g. once successful experiments are
[persisted]).

> üí° To include untracked files, stage them with `git add` first (before
> `dvc exp run`) and `git reset` them afterwards.

[persisted]: /doc/user-guide/experiment-management/persisting-experiments

</details>

To remove all experiments from the queue and start over, you can use
`dvc exp remove --queue`.

### Running experiments in parallel

DVC allows to run queued experiments in parallel by specifying a number of
execution processes (`--jobs`):

```dvc
$ dvc exp run --run-all --jobs 4
```

> Note that since each experiment runs in an independent temporary directory,
> common <abbr>stages</abbr> may sometimes be executed several times depending
> on the state of the [run-cache] at that time.

[run-cache]: /doc/user-guide/project-structure/internal-files#run-cache

‚ö†Ô∏è Parallel runs are experimental and may be unstable at this time. ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure
you're using a number of jobs that your environment can handle (no more than the
CPU cores).

## Checkpoint experiments

To track successive steps in a longer or deeper <abbr>experiment</abbr>, you can
register "checkpoints" from your code. These combine DVC Experiments with code
logging. The latter can be achieved either with [DVCLive](/doc/dvclive), by
using `dvc.api.make_checkpoint()` (Python code), or writing signal files (any
programming language) following the same steps as `make_checkpoint()`.

> üìñ See [Checkpoints](/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/checkpoints) to
> learn more about this feature.

Running checkpoint experiments is no different than with regular ones, e.g.:

```dvc
$ dvc exp run -S param=value
```

All checkpoints registered at runtime will be preserved, even if the process
gets interrupted (e.g. with `Ctrl+C`, or by an error). Without interruption, a
"wrap-up" checkpoint will be added (if needed), so that changes to pipeline
outputs don't remain in the workspace.

Subsequent uses of `dvc exp run` will continue from the latest checkpoint (using
the latest cached versions of all outputs). To resume from a previous checkpoint
(list them with `dvc exp show`), you must first `dvc exp apply` it before the
`dvc exp run`. For `--queue` or `--temp` runs, use `--rev` to specify the
checkpoint to continue from.

Alternatively, use `--reset` to start over (discards previous checkpoints and
their outputs). This is useful for re-training ML models, for example.

> Note that queuing an experiment that uses checkpoints implies `--reset`,
> unless a `--rev` is provided (refer to the previous section).
