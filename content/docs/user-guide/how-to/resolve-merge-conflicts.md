# How to Resolve Merge Conflicts in DVC Metafiles

Sometimes multiple team members work on the the same DVC-tracked data. When the
time comes to combine their changes, merge conflicts can occur in Git-tracked
<abbr>DVC files</abbr>, which need to be resolved.

## `dvc.yaml`

Conflicts here are no different from what we would see in source code. See
[Git Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).

```yaml
stages:
  prepare:
    cmd: python src/prepare.py data/data.xml
    deps:
< < < < < < < HEAD
    - data/big.xml
= = = = = = =
    - data/small.xml
> > > > > > > branch
    - src/prepare.py
    params:
    - prepare.seed
    - prepare.split
    outs:
    - data/prepared
```

## `dvc.lock`

There's no need to resolve lock file merge conflicts manually. You can safely
remove this file. After merging `dvc.yaml`, you can reproduce a clean `dvc.lock`
with `dvc repro`.

> `dvc commit` can also be a good option, but only for the specific case where
> the `HEAD` version is chosen.

## `.dvc` files

There are three main variations in the structure of these files, that differ by
the command that has generated them:

### Simple tracking (add)

In `.dvc` files generated by `dvc add`, you'll get something that looks like:

```yaml
outs:
< < < < < < < HEAD
- md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
  size: 12
= = = = = = =
- md5: 35dd1fda9cfb4b645ae431f4621fa324
  size: 100
> > > > > > > branch
  path: data.xml
```

You can pick one of the versions:

```yaml
outs:
  - md5: 35dd1fda9cfb4b645ae431f4621fa324
    size: 100
    path: data.xml
```

But if you want to actually merge the data files (or directories) of both
versions, then you can follow this process:

1. Run `dvc checkout data.xml` on both `HEAD` and `branch`;
2. Copy the data into temporary locations (e.g. `data.xml.head` and
   `data.xml.branch`);
3. Merge it by-hand;
4. Finally, run `dvc add data.xml` to overwrite the conflicted `.dvc` file.

### Directories

If you have a directory, DVC provides a [Git merge driver] that can
automatically resolve many merge conflicts for you. To use it, first set it up
in your Git repo:

```cli
$ git config merge.dvc.name 'DVC merge driver'
$ git config merge.dvc.driver \
      'dvc git-hook merge-driver --ancestor %O --our %A --their %B'
```

And add this line to your `.gitattributes` (in the root of your git repo):

```
*.dvc merge=dvc
```

Now, when a merge conflict occurs, DVC will simply combine data from both
branches.

<admon type="warn">

If the same file was added or changed in both branches, the merge driver will
fail unless the changes are the same. If the same file was deleted in both
branches, the merge driver will fail.

</admon>

### Imported data

To resolve merge conflicts in `.dvc` files generated by `dvc import` or
`dvc import-url`, remove the conflicted values altogether:

```yaml
< < < < < < < HEAD
md5: 263395583f35403c8e0b1b94b30bea32
=======
md5: 520d2602f440d13372435d91d3bfa176
> > > > > > > branch
frozen: true
deps:
- path: get-started/data.xml
  repo:
    url: https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry
< < < < < < < HEAD
    rev_lock: f31f5c4cdae787b4bdeb97a717687d44667d9e62
= = = = = = =
    rev_lock: 06be1104741f8a7c65449322a1fcc8c5f1070a1e
> > > > > > > branch
outs:
< < < < < < < HEAD
- md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
  size: 12
= = = = = = =
- md5: 35dd1fda9cfb4b645ae431f4621fa324
  size: 100
> > > > > > > branch
  path: data.xml
```

So you get something like this:

```yaml
frozen: true
deps:
  - path: get-started/data.xml
    repo:
      url: https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry
outs:
  - path: data.xml
```

And then `dvc update` the `.dvc` file to download the latest data from its
original source.

> Note that updating will bring in the latest version of the data from its
> source, which may not correspond with any of the hashes that was removed.
