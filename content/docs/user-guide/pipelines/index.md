# What is a (DVC) pipeline?

A machine learning pipeline is like an assembly line in a factory. As raw
materials input to a factory and processed at each step to achieve a final
product, a machine learning pipeline gets the data as an input, processes it in
every stage and outputs a model.

If you are repeating a set of commands to get to the final artifacts (models,
results), then you already have a pipeline, albeit in a manual fashion. DVC
allows to automate your workflow, be it comprised of a single command or many
commands with complex relationships.

## Stages

A pipeline is a collection of stages. At each stage, we define a (shell) command
to run and specify the inputs and outputs for this stage. By defining stage
input and outputs, we can find the order to run the stages. If an output of
stage `A` is fed as an input to stage `B`, then DVC infers to run `A` before
`B`.

`dvc stage` set of commands are used to create a pipeline by defining its
stages. Each stage requires a `name`, and a `command`. Additionally it describes
a set of dependencies and outputs. When these outputs are missing or the
dependencies are newer than the outputs, the command is run.

There are two equally valid ways to describe stages. The first is using
`dvc stage add` command, and the other is by editing `dvc.yaml`.

For example, to add a stage named `preprocess` depending on `preprocess.py`

```dvc
$ dvc stage add --name preprocess \
                --deps src/preprocess.py \
                --deps data/raw \
                --outs data/preprocessed \
                python src/preprocess.py
```

The other way to define a stage is through editing `dvc.yaml`. You could create
the file with the following content to create the above stage:

```yaml
stages:
  preprocess:
    cmd: python src/preprocess.py
    deps:
      - data/raw
      - src/preprocess.py
    outs:
      - data/preprocessed
```

Essentially the command creates the stage by writing to `dvc.yaml`file. If you
are creating the pipeline for the first time, adding the stages by
`dvc stage add` may be easier. If you're editing the pipeline though, working
with the YAML file might be easier.

Some advanced configuration for the stages may only be available through
editing `dvc.yaml`.

DVC works with YAML 1.2 and any version before this may have some minor quirks
that cause subtle bugs.

DVC assumes the command you specify in a stage changes the outputs you specify.
Otherwise, the stage may never be validated and the pipeline will always run.
