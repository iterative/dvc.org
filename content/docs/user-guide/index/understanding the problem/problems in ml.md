# Collaboration Issues in Data Science

It was long back, all the way back in 1763, that the first ideas of
Machine Learning emerged, through Thomas Bayes' work, [An Essay towards
solving a problem in the Doctorine of Chances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_towards_solving_a_Problem_in_the_Doctrine_of_Chances), 
and it wouldn't necessarily take a Tesla to realize that the road that took
Machine Learning from its humble beginnings to creating machines smart enough 
to beat the world GO champion just back in 2016, was tough. From 
recognizing cats on YouTube, to identifying cancer, Machine Learning, Deep Learning specifically, 
has been announced dead on several occasions, only to revive itself again. With a new wave 
of ML supremacy already here, it seems like this time, its here to stay. 


However, even with all the success we've seen today in machine learning (ML),
 especially after the big data hype of the last decade where generating 
massive datasets has become mainstream,  the data science community
still lacks good practices for organizing their projects and effectively 
collaborating across their varied ML projects. This fundamental challenge 
has rarely been addressed, partly because of our natural tendency to give 
attention to the more glamorous side of things, and partly because something 
as subtle as this is genrally hard to detect. 

To make progress, we need to begin understanding the such common elusive 
problems and begin formalizing them, answering the questions they pose in 
a unified, pricipled way.
