# Collaboration Issues in Data Science

Even with all the success we've seen today in machine learning (ML),
 especially after the big data hype of the last decade where generating 
massive datasets has become mainstream,  the data science community
still lacks good practices for organizing their projects and effectively 
collaborating across their varied ML projects. This fundamental challenge 
has rarely been addressed, partly because of our natural tendency to give 
attention to the more glamorous side of things, and partly because something 
as subtle as this is genrally hard to detect. 

To make progress, we need to begin understanding the such common elusive 
problems and begin formalizing them, answering the questions they pose in 
a unified, pricipled way.
