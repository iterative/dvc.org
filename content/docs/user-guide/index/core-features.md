# Core Features

Albeit being developed as an uncovential approach to what is already present, 
it is simple to understand DVC by recognising certain features it offers, 
based of the core concepts discussed previously:

- Git repositories lie at the heart of DVC, and hence share a similar command 
  line interface and workflow.

- It creates lightweight pipelines, which is used to make your data science 
  projects reproducible. 

- For large data versioning, DVC simply creates a special file in your Git 
  repository that points to the location which contains your data among other 
  things, typically stored on your hard drive. 

- DVC is Programming language agnostic: Python, R, Julia, shell scripts, etc. 
  as well as ML library agnostic: Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Scipy, etc.

- DVC is open-source and Self-serve, i.e it free and doesn't require any additional 
  services. 

- It even supports cloud storage (Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, Google 
  Cloud Storage, etc.) for data sources and pre-trained model sharing.
