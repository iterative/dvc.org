# Experiment management software

Before finally looking at what DVC is and how it is used, we need to understand
one last thing. What an Experiment Management Software is.

This new type of software was created to solve data science collaboration
issues. Experiment management software aims to cover the gap between data
scientist needs and the existing toolset from software engineering.

Experiment management software is usually graphical user interface (GUI) based,
in contrast to existing command line engineering tools. The GUI is a bridge to a
separate cloud based environment. The cloud environment is usually not as
flexible as local data scientist environments, and isn't fully integrated with
local environments either.

The separation of the local data scientist environment and the experimentation
cloud environment creates another discrepancy issue, and environment
synchronization requires addition work. Also, this style of software usually
requires external services that aren't free. This might be a good solution for a
particular companies or groups of data scientists. but a more accessible, free
tool is needed for a wider audience.
