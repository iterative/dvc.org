A file or directory produced as a _result_ of a <abbr>stage</abbr>. (cf.
<abbr>dependency</abbr>). A stage may have multiple outputs which in turn can
be a dependency to other stages in a <abbr>pipeline</abbr>.

Outputs are recorded in `outs` section of `dvc.yaml` or `.dvc` file. 

Any file or directory added to <abbr>project</abbr> with `dvc add` is
considered an output. i.e. in the most basic case, a file is an output of
itself. 

A file or directory added to the <abbr>repository</abbr> using `dvc import` as
an <abbr>external dependency</abbr> is also considered an output of another
repository.

A file or directory defined with `-o` or `-O` options of `dvc run` is
considered an output of that <abbr>stage</abbr>. 

Outputs and dependencies of a <abbr>pipeline</abbr> can be explicitly reported
by `dvc dag` using its `--outs` parameter.
