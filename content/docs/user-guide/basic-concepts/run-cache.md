  A log of stages that have been run in the project. It's comprised of
  `dvc.lock` file backups, identified as combinations of dependencies, commands,
  and outputs that correspond to each other. `dvc repro` and `dvc run` populate
  and reutilize the run-cache. See
  [Run-cache](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/internal-files#run-cache) for
  more details.
