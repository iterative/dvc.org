An attempt to reach desired/better/interesting results during data pipelining or
ML model development. DVC is designed to help
[manage experiments](/doc/user-guide/experiment-management), having built-in
mechanisms like the
[run-cache](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/internal-files#run-cache) and the
`dvc experiments` commands (coming in DVC 2.0).
