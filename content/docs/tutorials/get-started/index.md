# Get Started with DVC!

DVC is a **data version control**, pipeline management, and experiment
management tool that brings existing engineering toolsets and practices to data
science and machine learning. In this guide we will introduce the basic features
and concepts of DVC step by step.

## Initialize

Move into the directory you want to use as <abbr>workspace</abbr>, and use
`dvc init` inside to create a <abbr>DVC project</abbr>. It can contain existing
project files. At initialization, a new `.dvc/` directory is created for the
internal [files and directories](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories):

```dvc
$ dvc init
$ ls .dvc/
config  plots/  tmp/
```

DVC is typically initialized on top of Git, which is needed for the
[versioning](/doc/tutorials/get-started/data-versioning) features. The `.dvc/`
directory is automatically staged with Git by `dvc init`, so it can be committed
right away:

```dvc
$ git status
Changes to be committed:
        new file:   .dvc/.gitignore
        new file:   .dvc/config
        ...
$ git commit -m "Initialize DVC repo"
```

## What's ahead?

DVC functionality can be split into layers. Each one can be used independently,
but together they form a robust framework to capture and navigate machine
learning development.

- [Data **versioning**](/doc/tutorials/get-started/data-versioning) is the basic
  foundation for storing and sharing **evolving datasets** and ML models. We
  work on a regular Git workflow, without storing **large files** with Git.

- [Data **pipelines**](/doc/tutorials/get-started/data-pipelines) let you
  register data modeling **workflows** that can be managed and **reproduced**
  easily by you or others.

- [**Experiments**](/doc/tutorials/get-started/experiments) are a natural part
  of data science, or any R&D process. DVC provides special tools to define,
  manage, tune, and **compare them** through _parameters_ and _metrics_.
