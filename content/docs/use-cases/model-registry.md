# Machine Learning Model Registry

A **model registry** is a tool to catalog ML models and their versions. Models
from your data science projects can be discovered, tested, shared, deployed, and
audited from there. [Studio model registry] enables these capabilities [on top
of Git][gitops], so you can stick to an existing software engineering stack. No
more division between ML engineering and operations!

Model registry enables end-to-end workflows:

- **Log your model**: Start by logging your model's performance metrics and
  artifacts. Seamless integration with your existing ML framework allows you to
  log everything necessary for later model use and evaluation.

- **Compare experiments**: Once your models are logged, you can compare metrics,
  parameters, and plots for different iterations to choose the next model
  version.

- **Register model versions**: After comparing your models, you can register a
  semantic model version to mark an important iteration. This process of
  collecting and organizing model [versions] preserves their data provenance and
  lineage information, providing a clear history of model development.

- **Assign stage to model**: With your model registered, you can manage the
  lifecycle of your models. Models can be assigned to specific tasks or stages
  (e.g., dev, shadow, prod), and promoted through these stages based on their
  performance.

- **Download specific version**: To use a specific model version, you can
  download the latest or requested model version, or the version in the selected
  stage.

- **Deploy with CI/CD**: To enable automation, you can set up a continuous
  integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow that publishes or deploys
  your model. CI/CD can be triggered upon version registration or stage
  assignment automatically, creating a streamlined process for model deployment.

These steps provide a streamlined workflow from model development to deployment,
supporting all stages of ML model lifecycle.
