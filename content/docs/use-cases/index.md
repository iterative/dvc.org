# Use Cases

We provide short articles on common data science scenarios where DVC can help.

<admon info="tip">

Our use cases are not written to be run end-to-end like tutorials. For more
hands-on experience with DVC, see [Get Started](/doc/start).

## Why DVC?

Even with all the success we've seen in machine learning, especially with deep
learning and its applications in business, data scientists still lack best
practices for organizing their projects and collaborating effectively. This is a
critical challenge: while ML algorithms and methods are no longer tribal
knowledge, they are still difficult to develop, reuse, and manage.

## Basic uses of DVC

If you store and process data files or datasets to produce other data or machine
learning models, and you want to

- track and save data and machine learning models the same way you capture code;
- create and switch between
  [versions of data and ML models](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-models)
  easily;
- understand how datasets and ML artifacts were built in the first place;
- compare model metrics among <abbr>experiments</abbr>;
- adopt engineering tools and best practices in data science projects;

DVC is for you!
