# Use Cases

We provide short articles on common ML workflow and data science use cases that
DVC can help with or improve. Our use cases are not written to be run end-to-end
like tutorials. For more general, hands-on experience with DVC, please see
[Get Started](/doc/tutorials/get-started) instead.

## Why DVC?

Even with all the success we've seen today in machine learning (ML), especially
with deep learning and its applications in business, data scientists still lack
best practices for organizing their projects and collaborating effectively. This
is a critical challenge: while ML algorithms and methods are no longer tribal
knowledge, they are still difficult to implement, reuse, and manage.

## Basic uses of DVC

If you store and process data files or datasets to produce other data or machine
learning models, and you want to

- capture and save <abbr>data artifacts</abbr> the same way you capture code;
- track, control, and switch between different versions of data or models
  easily;
- understand how data or ML models were built in the first place;
- compare machine learning models and metrics to each other;
- bring software engineering best practices and tools to your data science team

DVC is for you!
