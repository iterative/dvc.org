# Collaboration Issues in Data Science

Even with all the success we've seen today in machine learning (ML),
specifically deep learning and its applications in business, the data science
community still lacks good practices for organizing their projects and
effectively collaborating across their varied ML projects. This is a critical
challenge: we need to evolve towards ML algorithms and methods no longer being
tribal knowledge and making them easy to implement, reuse, and manage.

We provide short articles on common ML workflow or data management scenarios
that DVC can help with or improve. These include the motivating context (usually
extracted from real-life cases); And the approaches to solving them can combine
several features of DVC. Use cases are not written to be run end-to-end. For
more general, hands-on experience with DVC, we recommend following the
[Get Started](/doc/tutorials/get-started), and/or [Tutorials](/doc/tutorials)
first.

> We keep reviewing our docs and will include interesting scenarios that surface
> in the community. Please, [contact us](/support) if you need help or have
> suggestions!
