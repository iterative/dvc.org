# Tutorial: Data Registry Basics

## Building registries

Adding datasets to a registry can be as simple as placing the data file or
directory in question inside the <abbr>workspace</abbr>, and track it with
`dvc add`. A standard Git workflow can be followed with the `.dvc` files that
substitute the actual data (e.g. `music/songs.dvc` below). This enables team
collaboration on data at the same level as with source code:

> This sample dataset actually
> [exists](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/getting-dataset/#subset).

```cli
$ mkdir -p music/songs
$ cp ~/Downloads/millionsongsubset_full music/songs

$ dvc add music/songs/

$ git add music/songs.dvc music/.gitignore
$ git commit -m "Track 1.8 GB 10,000 song dataset in music/"
```

The actual data is stored in the project's <abbr>cache</abbr>, and can be
[pushed](/doc/command-reference/push) to one or more [remote storage] locations
so the registry can be accessed from other locations and by other people:

```cli
$ dvc remote add -d myremote s3://mybucket/dvcstore
$ dvc push
```

> 💡 A good way to organize <abbr>DVC repositories</abbr> into data registries
> is to use directories to group similar data, e.g. `images/`,
> `natural-language/`, etc. For example, our
> [dataset registry](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry) has
> directories like `get-started/` and `use-cases/`, matching parts of this
> website.

## Using registries

The main methods to consume <abbr>artifacts</abbr> from a **data registry** are
the `dvc import` and `dvc get` commands, as well as the Python API `dvc.api`.
But first, we may want to explore its contents.

### Listing data

To explore the contents of a DVC repository in search for the right data, use
the `dvc list` command (similar to `ls` and 3rd-party tools like `aws s3 ls`):

```cli
$ dvc list -R https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry
.gitignore
README.md
get-started/.gitignore
get-started/data.xml
get-started/data.xml.dvc
images/.gitignore
images/dvc-logo-outlines.png
...
```

Both Git-tracked files and DVC-tracked data (or models, etc.) are listed.

### Data downloads

`dvc get` is analogous to using direct download tools like `wget` (HTTP),
`aws s3 cp` (S3), etc. To get a dataset from a DVC repo, we can run something
like this:

```cli
$ dvc get https://github.com/example/registry music/songs
```

This downloads `music/songs` from the <abbr>project</abbr>'s
[default remote](/doc/command-reference/remote/default) and places it in the
current working directory.

### Data import workflow

`dvc import` uses the same syntax as `dvc get`:

```cli
$ dvc import https://github.com/example/registry images/faces
```

Besides downloading the data, importing saves the information about the
dependency that the local project has on the data source (registry repo). This
is achieved by generating a special import `.dvc` file, which contains this
metadata.

Whenever the dataset changes in the registry, we can bring data up to date in
with `dvc update`:

```cli
$ dvc update faces.dvc
```

This downloads new and changed files, and removes deleted ones, based on the
latest commit in the source repo; And it updates the `.dvc` file accordingly.

> Note that `dvc get`, `dvc import`, and `dvc update` have a `--rev` option to
> download data from a specific [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions) of
> the source <abbr>repository</abbr>.

### Using DVC data from Python code

Our [Python API](/doc/api-reference), included with the `dvc` package installed
with DVC, includes the `open` function to load/stream data directly from
external <abbr>DVC projects</abbr>:

```python
import dvc.api

model_path = 'model.pkl'
repo_url = 'https://github.com/example/registry'

with dvc.api.open(model_path, repo_url) as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
    # ... Use the model!
```

This opens `model.pkl` as a file-like object. This example illustrates a simple
ML model **deployment** method, but it could be extended to more advanced
scenarios such as a _model zoo_.

See also the `dvc.api.read()` and `dvc.api.get_url()` functions.

## Updating registries

Datasets evolve, and DVC is prepared to handle it. Just change the data in the
registry, and apply the updates by running `dvc add` again:

```cli
$ cp 1000/more/songs/* music/songs/
$ dvc add music/songs/
```

DVC modifies the corresponding `.dvc` file to reflect the changes, and this is
picked up by Git:

```cli
$ git status
...
	modified:   music/songs.dvc
$ git commit -am "Add 1,000 more songs to music/ dataset."
```

Iterating on this process for several datasets can give shape to a robust
registry. The result is basically a repo that versions a set of
[metafiles](/doc/user-guide/project-structure). Let's see an example:

```cli
$ tree --filelimit=10
.
├── images
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── cats-dogs [2800 entries]  # Listed in .gitignore
│   ├── faces [10000 entries]     # Listed in .gitignore
│   ├── cats-dogs.dvc
│   └── faces.dvc
├── music
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── songs [11000 entries]     # Listed in .gitignore
│   └── songs.dvc
├── text
...
```

And let's not forget to `dvc push` data changes to the [remote storage], so
others can obtain them!

```cli
$ dvc push
```

## Managing registries

Now you know how to to build a lightweight data registry, update it, and get
files from it. As your registry or team continues to grow, you may have trouble
managing all artifacts across multiple projects. How do you keep them organized,
or know which version to use, or share them with others outside your team? DVC
along with [DVC Studio] can help you scale your registry and address these
questions.

### Adding metadata

You can record additional metadata about <abbr>artifacts</abbr> to help organize
them and make it easy for others to discover them. Add aliases and other
metadata to a `dvc.yaml` file in your project:

```yaml
# dvc.yaml
artifacts:
  get-started-data:
    path: get-started/data.xml.dvc
    type: data
    desc: 'Stack Overflow questions'
    labels:
      - nlp
      - classification
```

Once you `git commit` and `git push` this info to a project that's connected to
[DVC Studio], anyone on your team can see it and filter or search across all
your projects in the <abbr>model registry</abbr>. Although the artifact above is
not a model, you can change the filters to use it for any type of artifact:

### Registering versions and assigning stages

[Version numbers] and [stages] signal the commit to use and can trigger
automated workflows. Just like with software, you can use [semantic versioning]
to tag releases of your artifacts and to mark artifact versions as in
production, development, or other stages of their lifecycle:

![Assign Registry Datasets](https://static.iterative.ai/img/registry-assign-datasets.gif)

Versions and stages are saved as Git tags by [GTO]. This means that you have the
full release history in Git, and you can [trigger] deployments, tests, or other
actions in your CI/CD workflows when you register a version or assign a stage.

### Accessing artifacts

Others can [download or stream artifacts] by their version or stage without
needing access to your Git repository or cloud storage. If you connect your
[cloud credentials] in [DVC Studio], anyone on your team can access that
artifact using only a [Studio token], either in the UI or programmatically:
