# Get Started

Assuming DVC is already [installed](/doc/install), let's initialize it by
running `dvc init` inside a Git project:

<details>

### ⚙️ Expand to prepare the project.

We'll be building an NLP project from scratch together. The end result is
published on [GitHub](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started) -- feel
free to clone the repo.

Let's start with `git init`:

```dvc
$ mkdir example-get-started
$ cd example-get-started
$ git init
```

</details>

```dvc
$ dvc init
```

A few [internal files](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/internal-files) are
created that should be added to Git:

```dvc
$ git status
Changes to be committed:
        new file:   .dvc/.gitignore
        new file:   .dvc/config
        ...
$ git commit -m "Initialize DVC"
```

Now you're ready to DVC!

DVC's multiple feature sets are best understood from different angles. Pick a
trail below to see an overview of all features from that perspective:

### Data Management

- **[Data and model versioning]** is the base layer of DVC for large files,
  datasets, and machine learning models. Use a standard Git workflow, but
  without storing large files in the repo. Data is cached by DVC, allowing for
  efficient sharing. Think "Git for data".

- **[Data and model access]** shows how to bring, explore, and access data
  artifacts from outside the project. This can help download a specific version
  of an ML model to a deployment server or import a dataset into another
  project, for example.

- **[Data pipelines]** describe how models and other data artifacts are built,
  and provide an efficient way to reproduce them. Think "Makefiles for data and
  ML projects" done right.

- **[Metrics, parameters, and plots]** can be attached to pipelines. These let
  you capture, evaluate, and visualize ML projects without leaving Git.

[data pipelines]: /doc/start/data-management/data-pipelines
[metrics, parameters, and plots]:

### Experiment Management

- **[Experiments]** enable exploration, iteration, and comparison across many ML
  experiments. Track your experiments with automatic versioning and checkpoint
  logging. Compare differences in parameters, metrics, code, and data. Apply,
  drop, roll back, resume, or share any experiment.

- **[Visualization]** helps you compare experiment results visually, track your
  plots, and generate them with library integrations.
