# Get Started with DVC

<!--
## Get Started with DVC

Before we begin, settle on a directory for this guide. Everything we will do
will be self contained there.

### ⚙️ Expand to prepare a project.

Imagine we want to build an ML project from scratch. Let's start by creating a
Git repository:

```cli
$ mkdir example-get-started
$ cd example-get-started
$ git init
```

<admon type="info">

This directory name is used in our
[example-get-started](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started) repo.

</admon>

## Initializing a project

Inside your chosen directory, we will use our current working directory as a
<abbr>DVC project</abbr>. Let's initialize it by running `dvc init` inside a Git
project:

```cli
$ dvc init
```

A few [internal files](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/internal-files) are
created that should be added to Git:

```cli
$ git status
Changes to be committed:
        new file:   .dvc/.gitignore
        new file:   .dvc/config
        ...
$ git commit -m "Initialize DVC"
```

Now you're ready to DVC!

## Following This Guide

To help you understand and use DVC better, consider the following two use-cases:
**data management** and **experiment tracking**. You may pick either one to
start learning about how DVC helps you "solve" that scenario!

Choose a trail to jump into its first chapter:

- **[Data Management]** - Track and version large amounts of data along with
  your code, and use DVC as a build system for reproducible, data driven
  pipelines.

- **[Experiment Management]** - Easily track your experiments and their progress
  by only instrumenting your code, and collaborate on ML experiments like
  software engineers do for code.

[Experiment Management]: /doc/start/experiments/experiment-tracking

<admon type="tip">

Feel free to "choose your own adventure" and follow the chapters which answer
your specific needs. In case you're unsure where to start, we recommend starting
with **data management**.
