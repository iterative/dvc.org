# Get Started: Data Management

## Chapters

- **[Data and model versioning]** - Manage large files, datasets, and machine
  learning models. Track your data and couple its versions to your code
  versions, while keeping it stored properly outside of your Git repo.

- **[Data pipelines]** - Use pipelines to describe how models and other data
  artifacts are built, and provide an efficient way to reproduce them. Think
  "Makefiles for data and ML projects" done right.

- **[Metrics, parameters, and plots]** - Those are first class citizens in DVC
  pipelines. Capture, evaluate, and visualize ML projects without leaving Git.
