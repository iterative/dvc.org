# Get Started: Data Management

Let's look at DVC's features from the perspective of data and machine learning
model management. This includes automatic caching; versioning on top of Git
(without storing in the Git repo); sharing, exploring, and accessing remotely,
among other tasks.

We can also build and version pipelines to capture our data workflows stage by
stage, from raw data and its pre-processing, through feature engineering and ML
model training, and up to evaluation (performance metrics), visualization, or
other post-processing.
