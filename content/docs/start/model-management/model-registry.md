# Get Started: Model Registry

Just as we use experiment tracking to manage model development, it is a good
idea to keep a model registry to manage the lifecycle of the models we get from
our experiments. Using DVC and Studio we will set up a model registry where we
can discover, share, deploy and audit all our models and which will serve as the
single source of truth for our model management.

To make use of our model registry, we will need some trained models first. To
speed things up, we will start from a git
[repository](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started-model-management)
with a model training pipeline already set up and ready to use.

To see how you can track experiments and set up training pipelines with DVC,
have a look at our getting started guide for
[experiment management](/doc/start/experiments).

## DVC Model registry

- show where it is in Studio

## Adding models

We have three options how to add a model to the model registry. We can:

1. use DVCLive and add models using Python code
1. Use the Studio's graphical user interface to add models interactively
1. Manually edit `dvc.yaml` files to add information about model artifacts.

In our example repository we cover the first two options as the outcome of the
third one is identical to using the Studio GUI:

</tab>

<tab title="DVCLive">

```python
from dvclive import Live

...
with Live() as live:
    live.log_artifact(
        path="models/model.pkl",
        type="model",
        name="pool-segmentation",
        desc="This is a Computer Vision (CV) model that's segmenting out swimming pools from satellite images.",
        labels=["cv", "segmentation", "satellite-images"],
    )
```

</tab>

<tab title="Manual editing `dvc.yaml`">

```yaml
artifacts:
  pool-segmentation: # artifact ID (name)
    path: models/model.pkl
    type: model
    desc:
      "This is a Computer Vision (CV) model that's segmenting out swimming pools
      from satellite images."
    labels:
      - cv
      - segmentation
      - sattelite-images
    meta:
      framework: pytorch
```

</tab>

</toggle>

Each of these methods creates an entry in the `dvc.yaml` file (in the last
method this is done manually) which describes the model we are adding to the
model registry and lists its properties for DVC to show in Studio. The most
important properties are the `name` of the artifact, its `path` and `type`. The
model will be shown in the model registry under the given name, the path tells
dvc where to look for the versioned model artifact, and specifying artifact
`type` as`model` tells the model registry to show it (other artifact types are
ignored).

The rest of the properties are descriptive and `meta` allows you to add
additional properties which will not show up in the model registry.

## Versioning models

Once we have an artifact in the model registry, we can start registering model
versions. This can be done using the Studio UI as follows

- TODO - for a model version we can see the experiment metadata and observe the
  associated experiment directly
