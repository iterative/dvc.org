# Get Started: Model Registry

Just as we use experiment tracking to manage model development, it is a good
idea to keep a <abbr>model registry</abbr> to manage the lifecycle of the models
we get from our experiments. Using DVC and DVC [Studio](/doc/studio) we will set
up a model registry where we can discover, share, deploy and audit all our
models and which will serve as the single source of truth for our model
management.

<admon type="tip" id="GTO-tip">

Behind the scenes, Studio uses a command line tool called [GTO](<(/doc/gto)>)
for most model registry actions.

With GTO you can also set up the model registry locally without Studio (although
some functionality is exclusive to Studio). You can see how this is done in
expandable "Under the hood" sections which can be found throughout this chapter.

You can
[fork our example repository](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started-experiments/fork)
and follow the
[installation steps](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started-experiments#installation)
to set it up locally. To perform the model registry actions in this guide, sign
up to Studio, connect Studio to your GitHub account and add the forked project
using
[this guide](/doc/studio/user-guide/experiments/create-a-project#connect-to-a-git-repository-and-add-a-project).

## Adding models

Let's now train a model and add it to the model registry. We will be using
[DVCLive](/doc/dvclive) and add a model using Python code. This will also
automatically save the model to DVC.

We use the [`log_artifact`](/doc/dvclive/live/log_artifact) method to
<abbr>cache</abbr> the model with DVC and add it to the the model registry. Open
the training script `src/train.py` in our example repository and you will see
the following code under the `with Live(...)` context:

```python
with Live(...) as live:

...

    live.log_artifact(
        path="models/model.pkl",
        type="model",
        name="pool-segmentation",
        desc="This is a Computer Vision (CV) model that's segmenting out swimming pools from satellite images.",
        labels=["cv", "segmentation", "satellite-images"],
    )
```

Here the `path` parameter tells DVC that our model is to be found under
`"models/model.pkl"`, the `type` parameter is `"model"` and so it will show up
in Studio (other artifact types will not) and the rest of the parameters are
descriptive and optional and will also show up in the model registry.

<details id="push-click-to-see-how-artifacts-are-registered">

#### ðŸ’¡ Expand to see how adding models to the registry works under the hood

When we call the `log_artifact()` method, DVC takes all the information we
provide in the call and edits the `dvc.yaml` file which will now contain the
following lines:

```yaml
artifacts:
  pool-segmentation:
    path: models/model.pkl
    type: model
    desc:
      This is a Computer Vision (CV) model that's segmenting out swimming pools
      from satellite images.
    labels:
      - cv
      - segmentation
      - satellite-images
```

When you push the resulting file to your Git remote it is parsed by Studio and
it then shows all model artifacts from your `dvc.yaml` files in the model
registry.

</details>

Now we just need to run the python script which includes this code to cache and
register the model. If you are following our example repository then the
training script is included in a DVC pipeline
[we prepared](/doc/start/experiments/experiment-pipelines) in the Experiment
Management guide, so we can just call `dvc exp run` to run the entire experiment
pipeline.

We now commit the result to Git (and push it to our Git remote) and the new
model will show up in the model registry in Studio.

To get acquainted with how DVC stores and shares data, see our
[Get Started guide on Data Versioning](/doc/start/data-management/data-versioning).

<details id="push-click-to-see-other-ways-to-add-models">

#### ðŸ’¡ Expand to see other ways to add models

The other two options are to use the Studio's graphical user interface to add
models interactively or to manually edit `dvc.yaml` files to add information
about model artifacts. To get more details on the ways to add models have a look
at the
[Model registry documentation](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/add-a-model).

</details>

## DVC Model registry overview

In this guide, we will be using [DVC Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai) to
manage our model registry. Studio enables you to see models across all projects,
manage their lifecycle, and download them with only a token. You can find out
more about it [here](/doc/studio).

From the Models tab we will have an overview of all models, latest model
versions as well stages each of the model versions is assigned to. We can get
more details for each model by clicking on the model name.

You can check out our
[example model](https://studio.iterative.ai/team/Iterative/models/b3P4bcYIrGYdzyjqzsf9Xw==/pool-segmentation/v0.1.0)
in Studio to see what it will look like once we finish all the steps in this
guide.

Now that we have added a model, we should see something like the following
picture in Studio.

![Newly added model in the Model Registry](/img/mr-newly-added-model.png)

You can also see the
[state of the project at this point](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started-experiments/releases/tag/2-dvc-pipeline)
captured in our example repository.

## Versioning models

Now that we have our first model in the model registry, we can start registering
model versions for the model. We do it by choosing a specific commit in our
model development history and attaching a version to it to keep an easier track
of it. We will do that directly in the Studio UI as follows.

![Registering model versions](/img/mr-register-model-version.gif)

Since we just saved our model to DVC and added it to the model registry in the
previous commit, we can just keep the commit which was selected automatically.
We will also keep the suggested version number. For more details and other ways
of registering model versions you can have a look at the corresponding
[documentation](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/register-version).

Once we register our first model version, the model registry will also
automatically connect it to experiment tracking and all metrics which are
tracked for each model version will also show up in the model registry. We can
even explore the experiment directly by clicking on the "Open in Project" button
on the model detail page.

<details id="under-the-hood-model-registry">

#### ðŸ’¡ Expand to see how the model registry works under the hood

When you register model versions, assign or remove stages or deprecate models,
GTO assigns [particularly formatted](/doc/gto/user-guide#git-tags-format) git
[tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) to selected commits
and these are then parsed by the model registry to keep track of the model
lifecycle history.

This means that all the metadata used by the model registry is actually stored
in your git repo!

It also allows you to use GTO directly instead of the Studio UI to manage your
model lifecycle. That can be useful for example if you want to trigger certain
model registry actions programmatically. You can learn more about the details of
GTO in its [documentation](/docs/gto).

</details>

<details>

#### ðŸ’¡ Expand to see how registering models works under the hood

Registering the model version as we just did using DVC Studio is equivalent to
the following GTO command

```
gto register pool-segmentation [ref] --version v1.0.0
```

Here, `[ref]` is the git reference/hash we selected from the menu in Studio.

For more details you can have a look at the
[gto register command reference](/doc/gto/command-reference/register).

</details>

## Assigning lifecycle stages

We have a first version for our model and now it is a good time to assign a
model lifecycle stage to it. You can create any number of lifecycle stages with
any names you wish but in this example we will only create two stages called
"dev" and "prod".

Stages are created whenever a model version is assigned to them. We will now
assign our model to the "dev" stage as follows.

![Assigning model stages](/img/mr-assign-model-stage.gif)

<details id="under-the-hood-assigning-model-stages">

#### ðŸ’¡ Expand to see how assigning model stages works under the hood

Assigning the "dev" stage to the model as we just did using DVC Studio is
equivalent to the following GTO command

```
gto assign pool-segmentation --version v1.0.0 --stage dev
```

For more details you can have a look at the
[gto assign command reference](/doc/gto/command-reference/assign).

</details>

## Changing (and removing) stage assignments

Let's say that we've decided to promote our model version 1.0.0 to production.
We will assign the model version to the "prod" stage just like we did with the
"dev" stage in the previous section. When we assing the model to a stage, it can
automatically trigger actions in our CICD workflows, like deploying the model to
a new environment (we will explore how this is done in the [Using and Deploying
models] (/doc/start/model-management/model-cicd) chapter).

The detailed view of our model in the registry should now match what we see
[in our example](<(https://studio.iterative.ai/team/Iterative/models/b3P4bcYIrGYdzyjqzsf9Xw==/pool-segmentation/v0.1.0)>).

It is also possible to remove stage assignments, de-register model versions or
deprecate and remove models from the registry entirely.

We will un-assign the "dev" stage from our model version 1.0.0 now:

![Un-assigning model stages](/img/placeholder-cat.gif)

To see how you can de-register model versions and deprecate models, have a look
at the
[documentation](/doc/studio/user-guide/model-registry/remove-a-model-or-its-details).

<details id="under-the-hood-removing-stages">

#### ðŸ’¡ Expand to see how removing model stages works under the hood

Whenever we un-assign stages, de-register model versions and deprecate models,
Studio uses the GTO library under the hood. It is also possible to use GTO
manually to perform these actions. To see how, have a look at the
[gto deprecate command reference](/doc/gto/command-reference/deprecate).

</details>

## Auditing model history

Every action we performed in our model registry leaves a trace so that the model
history can be audited. If we now look at the model details page of our model,
we should see something like this:

![Model history](/img/mr-model-history.png)

As we noted [above](/docs/start/model-management/model-registry#GTO-tip), DVC
uses special git tags to keep track of model registry actions, so all of this
history is actually stored directly in your git repository. DVC Studio can parse
these tags and show them to us in a user-friendly way.

If you look at the
[tags in our example repository](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started-experiments/tags),
you can see that all the model registry actions that we performed are captured
by such tags.
