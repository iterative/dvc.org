# Get Started: Model Management

## Chapters

- **[Model registry]** - Set up a git-based model registry with DVC to track and
  manage models, their versions and lifecycle stages.

- **[Using and deploying models]** - Easily download your models from the model
  registry. Set up your CICD pipelines to be trigger by model registry actions
  (such as assigning model stages) and deploy models directly form the model
  registry.
