# Get Started: Experiment Collaboration

After having compared some experiments' results and parameters, you still need
to agree on which one is the best, share it, track it, and do some house keeping
on the rejected experiments.

<abbr>DVC Experiments</abbr> are fully compatible with Git workflows. You can
share, manage and collaborate on experiments and related code changes using
software engineering best practices. There is no need for a different system or
paradigm to track and version experiments.

## Sharing

Unless you have enabled
[Studio Live Experiments](/doc/studio/user-guide/projects-and-experiments/live-metrics-and-plots),
the <abbr>DVC experiments</abbr> only exist in your repo and people can't manage
or view them from other machines.

To share an experiment with others from your machine:

<toggle>

<tab title="DVC CLI">

You can use `dvc exp push`, providing the names of the git remote and the
experiment:

```cli
$ dvc exp push origin "soupy-leak"
```

People from other machines can then retrieve it using `dvc exp pull`:

```cli
$ dvc exp pull origin "soupy-leak"
```

</tab>

<tab title="VSCode Extension">

You can right-click on the experiment row and select the `Push Selected` action:

</tab>

<tab title="Studio">

Manage shared experiments from [Studio]:

![Studio Shared Experiments](/img/studio-shared-exps.png)

</tab>

</toggle>

<admon type="info">

## Persisting

Once you have agreed on the best experiment, you can create a git branch and
manage it using regular Git workflows:

<toggle>

<tab title="DVC CLI">

You can use `dvc exp branch`, providing the name of the experiment and the
future branch:

```cli
$ dvc exp branch "soupy-leak"
Git branch 'soupy-leak-branch' has been created from experiment 'soupy-leak'.
```

</tab>

<tab title="VSCode Extension">

You can right-click on the experiment row and select the `Create a new Branch`
action:

![VSCode Create a New Branch](/img/vscode-branch.gif)

</tab>

<tab title="Studio">

You can click to the right of the experiment and select the
`Create branch/pull request` action:

![Studio Create a New Branch](/img/studio-branch.gif)

</tab>

</toggle>

This allows you to use software engineering best practices to manage
experiments, like creating
[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests):

```cli
$ gh pr create -H soupy-leak-branch --title "Experiment: soupy-leak"
```

<admon type="info">

</admon>

## Cleaning

After deciding on which experiments to persist, you might want to remove those
that you no longer want to keep:

<toggle>

<tab title="DVC CLI">

You can use `dvc exp remove` to manually remove experiment(s) using their names:

```cli
$ dvc exp remove bifid-says potty-sash
```

</tab>

<tab title="VSCode Extension">

You can select multiple experiment rows and use the `Remove selected` action:

![VSCode Remove selected rows](/img/vscode-remove.gif)

</tab>

<tab title="Studio">

You can click to the right of the experiment and use the `Delete` action:

![Studio Remove selected rows](/img/studio-remove.gif)

</tab>

</toggle>
<admon type="info">
