# Get Started: Experiment Management

## Chapters

- **[Experiment tracking]** - Instrument your code to quickly start tracking
  experiments. Manage changes to code, data, metrics, parameters and plots
  associated with each experiment without bloating your Git repo.

- **[Collaborating on experiments]** - Manage experiments the same way
  developers manage code. Share experiments with your team over git, create
  branches and pull requests, and compare results.

- **[Experimenting using pipelines]** - Leverage DVC data pipelines as an
  experiment management system. Split your workflow into stages, track
  dependencies and outputs, and natively inject parameters and hyper-parameters
  to experiment runs.
