# Visualization with DVC Plots

In parallel with versioning parameters and metrics by associating them with
experiments, DVC allows to generate plots from multivariate outputs. There are
several options to generate and keep track of the plots:

- DVC, with its DVCLive integration can produce plots automatically during
  training.

- DVC can generate HTML files that includes interactive Vega-Lite plots, from
  the data series in JSON, YAML, CSV, or TSV.

- DVC can keep track of image files produced as plot outputs from the
  training/evaluation scripts.

We'll add visualization to [`example-dvc-experiments`][ede] project. You may
refer to the [earlier section] to install it.

One of the important plots that shows the classification performance is the
confusion matrix. DVC uses Vega-Lite to plot the text files. In order to produce
a confusion matrix, Vega expects a CSV file in the form:

```csv
actual,predicted
0,0
0,2
...
```

We add the following loop at the end of the training function:

```python
    y_prob = m.predict(x_valid)
    y_pred = y_prob.argmax(axis=-1)
    os.makedirs("plots")
    with open("plots/confusion.csv", "w") as f:
        f.write("actual,predicted\n")
        sx = y_valid.shape[0]
        for i in range(sx):
            f.write(f"{y_valid.argmax()},{y_pred[i]}\n")
```

After running the experiment, with `dvc exp run`, DVC will produce
`plots/confusion.csv` file that can be shown in the web browser:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show plots/confusion.csv --template confusion
file:///Users/.../example-dvc-experiments/plots/confusion.json.html
```

The file contains the following plot that shows the performance of the CNN
classifier:

<<IMAGE_GOES_HERE>>

Now, let's produce another plot to see misclassified examples from each class.
This procedure is a bit more complex than creating a CSV file, and skipped here,
but you can see the code in [Github][misclassified-example-code]

We can see the misclassification examples in the browser:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show plots/misclassified.png --open
```

DVC automatically shows the image in an HTML page.

<<IMAGE_GOES_HERE>>

A major requirement for deep learning projects is to see in which epoch training
loss and validation loss differs. DVC helps in that regard with its integrations
to major deep learning libraries via DVCLive.

We use the following code snippet to see the training loss

- [ ] Configure the plots to use dvclive output
- [ ] Generate a plot file and open it in the browser
- [ ] Generate a plot image and use `dvc plot` on it
