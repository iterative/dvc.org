# Get Started: Data Pipelines

Versioning large data files and directories for data science is great, but not
enough. How is data filtered, transformed, or used to train ML models? DVC
introduces a mechanism to capture _data pipelines_ — series of data processes
that produce a final result.

DVC pipelines and their data can also be easily versioned (using Git). This
allows you to better organize projects, and reproduce your workflow and results
later — exactly as they were built originally! For example, you could capture a
simple ETL workflow, organize a data science project, or build a detailed
machine learning pipeline.

Watch and learn, or follow along with the code example below!

## Pipeline stages

Use `dvc run` to create _stages_. These represent processes (source code tracked
with Git) which form the steps of a _pipeline_. Stages also connect code to its
corresponding data _input_ and _output_. Let's transform a Python script into a
[stage](/doc/command-reference/run):

<details>

### ⚙️ Expand to download example code.

Get the sample code like this:

```dvc
$ wget https://code.dvc.org/get-started/code.zip
$ unzip code.zip
$ rm -f code.zip
$ tree
.
├── params.yaml
└── src
    ├── evaluate.py
    ├── featurization.py
    ├── prepare.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── train.py
```

Now let's install the requirements:

> We **strongly** recommend creating a
> [virtual environment](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/library/venv.html)
> first.

```dvc
$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

Please also add or commit the source code directory with Git at this point.

</details>

```dvc
$ dvc run -n prepare \
          -p prepare.seed,prepare.split \
          -d src/prepare.py -d data/data.xml \
          -o data/prepared \
          python src/prepare.py data/data.xml
```

A `dvc.yaml` file is generated. It includes information about the command we ran
(`python src/prepare.py data/data.xml`), its <abbr>dependencies</abbr>, and
<abbr>outputs</abbr>.

<details>

### 💡 Expand to see what happens under the hood.

The command options used above mean the following:

- `-n prepare` specifies a name for the stage. If you open the `dvc.yaml` file
  you will see a section named `prepare`.

- `-p prepare.seed,prepare.split` defines special types of dependencies —
  [parameters](/doc/command-reference/params). We'll get to them later in the
  [Metrics, Parameters, and Plots](/doc/start/metrics-parameters-plots) page,
  but the idea is that the stage can depend on field values from a parameters
  file (`params.yaml` by default):

```yaml
prepare:
  split: 0.20
  seed: 20170428
```

- `-d src/prepare.py` and `-d data/data.xml` mean that the stage depends on
  these files to work. Notice that the source code itself is marked as a
  dependency. If any of these files change later, DVC will know that this stage
  needs to be [reproduced](#reproduce).

- `-o data/prepared` specifies an output directory for this script, which writes
  two files in it. This is how the <abbr>workspace</abbr> should look like now:

  ```git
   .
   ├── data
   │   ├── data.xml
   │   ├── data.xml.dvc
  +│   └── prepared
  +│       ├── test.tsv
  +│       └── train.tsv
  +├── dvc.yaml
  +├── dvc.lock
   ├── params.yaml
   └── src
       ├── ...
  ```

- The last line, `python src/prepare.py data/data.xml` is the command to run in
  this stage, and it's saved to `dvc.yaml`, as shown below.

The resulting `prepare` stage contains all of the information above:

```yaml
stages:
  prepare:
    cmd: python src/prepare.py data/data.xml
    deps:
      - src/prepare.py
      - data/data.xml
    params:
      - prepare.seed
      - prepare.split
    outs:
      - data/prepared
```

</details>

There's no need to use `dvc add` for DVC to track stage outputs (`data/prepared`
in this case); `dvc run` already took care of this. You only need to run
`dvc push` if you want to save them to
[remote storage](/doc/start/data-and-model-versioning#storing-and-sharing),
(usually along with `git commit` to version `dvc.yaml` itself).

## Dependency graphs (DAGs)

By using `dvc run` multiple times, and specifying <abbr>outputs</abbr> of a
stage as <abbr>dependencies</abbr> of another one, we can describe a sequence of
commands which gets to a desired result. This is what we call a _data pipeline_
or [_dependency graph_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

Let's create a second stage chained to the outputs of `prepare`, to perform
feature extraction:

```dvc
$ dvc run -n featurize \
          -p featurize.max_features,featurize.ngrams \
          -d src/featurization.py -d data/prepared \
          -o data/features \
          python src/featurization.py data/prepared data/features
```

The `dvc.yaml` file is updated automatically and should include two stages now.

<details>

### 💡 Expand to see what happens under the hood.

The changes to the `dvc.yaml` should look like this:

```git
 stages:
   prepare:
     cmd: python src/prepare.py data/data.xml
     deps:
     - data/data.xml
     - src/prepare.py
     params:
     - prepare.seed
     - prepare.split
     outs:
     - data/prepared
+  featurize:
+    cmd: python src/featurization.py data/prepared data/features
+    deps:
+    - data/prepared
+    - src/featurization.py
+    params:
+    - featurize.max_features
+    - featurize.ngrams
+    outs:
+    - data/features
```

</details>

<details>

### ⚙️ Expand to add more stages.

Let's add the training itself. Nothing new this time; just the same `dvc run`
command with the same set of options:

```dvc
$ dvc run -n train \
          -p train.seed,train.n_est,train.min_split \
          -d src/train.py -d data/features \
          -o model.pkl \
          python src/train.py data/features model.pkl
```

Please check the `dvc.yaml` again, it should have one more stage now.

</details>

This should be a good time to commit the changes with Git. These include
`.gitignore`, `dvc.lock`, and `dvc.yaml` — which describe our pipeline.

## Reproduce

The whole point of creating this `dvc.yaml` file is the ability to easily
reproduce a pipeline:

```dvc
$ dvc repro
```

<details>

### ⚙️ Expand to have some fun with it.

Let's try to play a little bit with it. First, let's try to change one of the
parameters for the training stage:

1. Open `params.yaml` and change `n_est` to `100`, and
2. (re)run `dvc repro`.

You should see:

```dvc
$ dvc repro
Stage 'prepare' didn't change, skipping
Stage 'featurize' didn't change, skipping
Running stage 'train' with command: ...
```

DVC detected that only `train` should be run, and skipped everything else! All
the intermediate results are being reused.

Now, let's change it back to `50` and run `dvc repro` again:

```dvc
$ dvc repro
Stage 'prepare' didn't change, skipping
Stage 'featurize' didn't change, skipping
```

As before, there was no need to rerun `prepare`, `featurize`, etc. But this time
it also doesn't rerun `train`! The previous run with the same set of inputs
(parameters & data) was saved in DVC's <abbr>run-cache</abbr>, and reused here.

</details>

<details>

### 💡 Expand to see what happens under the hood.

`dvc repro` relies on the <abbr>DAG</abbr> definition from `dvc.yaml`, and uses
`dvc.lock` to determine what exactly needs to be run.

The `dvc.lock` file is similar to a `.dvc` file — it captures hashes (in most
cases `md5`s) of the dependencies and values of the parameters that were used.
It can be considered a _state_ of the pipeline:

```yaml
schema: '2.0'
stages:
  prepare:
    cmd: python src/prepare.py data/data.xml
    deps:
      - path: data/data.xml
        md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
      - path: src/prepare.py
        md5: 285af85d794bb57e5d09ace7209f3519
    params:
      params.yaml:
        prepare.seed: 20170428
        prepare.split: 0.2
    outs:
      - path: data/prepared
        md5: 20b786b6e6f80e2b3fcf17827ad18597.dir
```

> `dvc status` command can be used to compare this state with an actual state of
> the workspace.

</details>

DVC pipelines (`dvc.yaml` file, `dvc run`, and `dvc repro` commands) solve a few
important problems:

- _Automation_: run a sequence of steps in a "smart" way which makes iterating
  on your project faster. DVC automatically determines which parts of a project
  need to be run, and it caches "runs" and their results to avoid unnecessary
  reruns.
- _Reproducibility_: `dvc.yaml` and `dvc.lock` files describe what data to use
  and which commands will generate the pipeline results (such as an ML model).
  Storing these files in Git makes it easy to version and share.
- _Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration (CI/CD) for ML_: describing
  projects in way that can be reproduced (built) is the first necessary step
  before introducing CI/CD systems. See our sister project
  [CML](https://cml.dev/) for some examples.

## Visualize

Having built our pipeline, we need a good way to understand its structure.
Seeing a graph of connected stages would help. DVC lets you do so without
leaving the terminal!

```dvc
$ dvc dag
         +---------+
         | prepare |
         +---------+
              *
              *
              *
        +-----------+
        | featurize |
        +-----------+
         **        **
       **            *
      *               **
+-------+               *
| train |             **
+-------+            *
         **        **
           **    **
             *  *
        +----------+
        | evaluate |
        +----------+
```
