# Get Started: Data Pipelines

## Chapters

- **[Data pipelines]** - Use pipelines to describe how models and other data
  artifacts are built, and provide an efficient way to reproduce them. Think
  "Makefiles for data and ML projects" done right.

- **[Metrics, parameters, and plots]** - These are first class citizens in DVC
  pipelines. Capture, evaluate, and visualize ML projects without leaving Git.
