# Get Started: Data Versioning

How cool would it be to make Git handle arbitrary large files and directories
with the same performance as with small code files? Imagine doing a `git clone`
and seeing data files and machine learning models in the workspace. Or switching
to a different version of a 100Gb file in less than a second with a
`git checkout`.

The foundation of DVC consists of a few commands that you can run along with
`git` to track large files, directories, or ML models. Think "Git for data".
Read on or watch our video to learn about versioning data with DVC!

To start tracking a file or directory, use `dvc add`:

<details>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Expand to get an example dataset.

Having initialized a project in the previous section, get the data file we will
be using later like this:

```dvc
$ mkdir data
$ dvc get https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry \
          get-started/data.xml -o data/data.xml
```

We use the fancy `dvc get` command to jump ahead a bit and show how Git repo
becomes a source for datasets or models - what we call "data registry" or "model
registry". `dvc get` can download any file or directory tracked in a <abbr>DVC
repository</abbr>. It's like `wget`, but for DVC or Git repos. In this case we
download the latest version of the `data.xml` file from the
[dataset registry](https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry) repo as the
data source.

</details>

```dvc
$ dvc add data/data.xml
```

DVC stores information about the added file (or a directory) in a special `.dvc`
file named `data/data.xml.dvc`, a small text file with a human-readable
[format](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/dvc-files). This file can be easily
versioned like source code with Git, as a placeholder for the original data
(which gets listed in `.gitignore`):

```dvc
$ git add data/data.xml.dvc data/.gitignore
$ git commit -m "Add raw data"
```

<details>

### üí° Expand to see what happens under the hood.

`dvc add` moved the data to the project's <abbr>cache</abbr>, and linked\* it
back to the <abbr>workspace</abbr>.

```dvc
$ tree .dvc/cache
../.dvc/cache
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ a3
¬†¬†  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 04afb96060aad90176268345e10355
```

The hash value of the `data.xml` file we just added (`a304afb...`) determines
the cache path shown above. And if you check `data/data.xml.dvc`, you will find
it there too:

```yaml
outs:
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: data.xml
```

> [Large Dataset Optimization](/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization) and
> `dvc config cache` for more info. on file linking.

</details>

## Storing and sharing

You can upload DVC-tracked data or models with `dvc push`, so they're safely
stored [remotely](/doc/command-reference/remote). This also means they can be
retrieved on other environments later with `dvc pull`. First, we need to setup a
storage:

```dvc
$ dvc remote add -d storage s3://my-bucket/dvc-storage
$ git add .dvc/config
$ git commit -m "Configure remote storage"
```

> DVC supports the following remote storage types: Google Drive, Amazon S3,
> Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Aliyun OSS, SSH, HDFS, and HTTP.
> Please refer to `dvc remote add` for more details and examples.

<details>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Set up a remote storage

DVC remotes let you store a copy of the data tracked by DVC outside of the local
cache, usually a cloud storage service. For simplicity, let's set up a _local
remote_:

```dvc
$ mkdir -p /tmp/dvc-storage
$ dvc remote add -d myremote /tmp/dvc-storage
$ git commit .dvc/config -m "Configure local remote"
```

> While the term "local remote" may seem contradictory, it doesn't have to be.
> The "local" part refers to the type of location: another directory in the file
> system. "Remote" is how we call storage for <abbr>DVC projects</abbr>. It's
> essentially a local data backup.

</details>

```dvc
$ dvc push
```

Usually, we also want to `git commit` and `git push` the corresponding `.dvc`
files.

<details>

### üí° Expand to see what happens under the hood.

`dvc push` copied the data <abbr>cached</abbr> locally to the remote storage we
set up earlier. You can check that the data has been stored in the DVC remote
with:

```dvc
$ ls -R /tmp/dvc-storage
/tmp/dvc-storage/:
a3

/tmp/dvc-storage/a3:
04afb96060aad90176268345e10355
```

</details>

## Retrieving

Having DVC-tracked data stored remotely, it can be downloaded when needed in
other copies of this <abbr>project</abbr> with `dvc pull`. Usually, we run it
after `git clone` and `git pull`.

<details>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Expand to explode the project üí£

If you've run `dvc push`, you can delete the cache (`.dvc/cache`) and
`data/data.xml` to experiment with `dvc pull`:

```dvc
$ rm -rf .dvc/cache
$ rm -f data/data.xml
```

</details>

```dvc
$ dvc pull
```

> for more on basic collaboration workflows.

## Making changes

When you make a change to a file or directory, run `dvc add` again to track the
latest version:

<details>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Expand to make some changes.

For the sake of simplicity let's just double the dataset artificially (and
pretend that we got more data from some external source):

```dvc
$ cp data/data.xml /tmp/data.xml
$ cat /tmp/data.xml >> data/data.xml
```

</details>

```dvc
$ dvc add data/data.xml
```

Usually you would also run `git commit` and `dvc push` to save the changes:

```dvc
$ git commit data/data.xml.dvc -m "Dataset updates"
$ dvc push
```

## Switching between versions

The regular workflow is to use `git checkout` first to switch a branch, checkout
a commit, or a revision of a `.dvc` file, and then run `dvc checkout` to sync
data:

```dvc
$ git checkout <...>
$ dvc checkout
```

<details>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Expand to get the previous version of the dataset.

Let's cleanup the previous artificial changes we made and get the previous :

```dvc
$ git checkout HEAD^1 data/data.xml.dvc
$ dvc checkout
```

Let's commit it (no need to do `dvc push` this time since the previous version
of this dataset was saved before):

```dvc
$ git commit data/data.xml.dvc -m "Revert dataset updates"
```

</details>

Yes, DVC is technically not even a version control system! `.dvc` files content
defines data file versions. Git itself provides the version control. DVC in turn
creates these `.dvc` files, updates them, and synchronizes DVC-tracked data in
the <abbr>workspace</abbr> efficiently to match them.

## Large datasets versioning

In cases where you process very large datasets, you need an efficient mechanism
(in terms of space and performance) to share a lot of data, including different
versions of itself. Do you use a network attached storage? Or a large external
volume?

While these cases are not covered in the Get Started, we recommend reading the
following sections next to learn more about advanced workflows:

- A shared [external cache](/doc/use-cases/shared-development-server) can be set
  up to store, version and access a lot of data on a large shared volume
  efficiently.
- A quite advanced scenario is to track and version data directly on the remote
  storage (e.g. S3). Check out
  [Managing External Data](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/managing-external-data)
  to learn more.
