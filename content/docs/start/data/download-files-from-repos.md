## Download

One way is to simply download the data with `dvc get`. This is useful when
working outside of a <abbr>DVC project</abbr> environment, for example in an
automated ML model deployment task:

```dvc
$ dvc get https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry \
          use-cases/cats-dogs
```

When working inside another DVC project though, this is not the best strategy
because the connection between the projects is lost — others won't know where
the data came from or whether new versions are available.
