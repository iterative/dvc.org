# DVCLive()

Initializes a DVCLive logger.

```py
class DVCLive:
    DEFAULT_DIR = "dvclive"

    def __init__(
        self,
        path: Optional[str] = None,
        resume: bool = False,
        summary: bool = True,
    ):
```

#### Usage:

```py
from dvclive import DVCLive

dvclive = DVCLive()
```

## Description

It's usage is focused on configuring the behavior of subsequent calls to
`dvclive.log()`.

⚠️ If `path` already exists when this functions is called, a cleanup will remove
all existing DVCLive related files.

## Parameters

- `path` - (`None` by default) - Configure where to save _metrics logs_ and
  _metrics summary_ (generated by `dvclive.log()`).

If `None` and DVC is enabled (see
[DVCLive with DVC](/docs/dvclive/dvclive-with-dvc)), the `path` set by DVC will
be used. Otherwise the default value (`dvclive`) will be used.

- `resume` - (`False` by default) - if `True`, DVCLive will try to read the
  previous `step` from the `path` directory and start from that point.

- `summary` - (`True` by default) - if `True`, upon each `dvclive.log()` call,
  DVCLive will generate a _metrics summary_ (usable by `dvc metrics`). The
  _summary_ will be located at `{path}.json`.

## Exceptions

- `dvclive.error.ConfigMismatchError` - thrown if the provided `path` does not
  match with the one set in DVC (see
  [DVCLive with DVC](/docs/dvclive/dvclive-with-dvc))
