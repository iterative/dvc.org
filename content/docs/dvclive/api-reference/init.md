# dvclive.init()

Initializes a DVCLive logger.

```py
def init(
    path: str = None,
    resume: bool = False,
    step: int = 0,
    summary: bool = True,
    html: bool = True,
)
```

#### Usage:

```py
import dvclive

dvclive.init()
```

## Description

It's usage is optional and focused on configuring the behavior of subsequent
calls to [`dvclive.log()`] and [`dvclive.next_step()`].

⚠️ If `path` already exists when this functions is called, it's contents will be
removed.

## Parameters

- `path` (`dvclive` by default) - Configure where to save _metrics logs_ and
  _metrics summary_ (generated by [`dvclive.log()`] and [`dvclive.next_step()`],
  respectively).

- `step` (`0` by default) - the `step` values in _metrics logs_ files will start
  incrementing from this value (see [`dvclive.log`].

- `resume` - (`False` by default) - if `True`, DVCLive will try to read the
  previous `step` from the `path` directory and start from that point (unless a
  `step`, other than `0`, is passed explicitly).

- `summary` (`True` by default) - if `True`, upon each [`dvclive.next_step()`]
  call, DVCLive will generate a _metrics summary_ (usable by `dvc metrics`). The
  _summary_ will be located at `{path}.json`.

- `html` (`True` by default) - works only when DVCLive is used alongside DVC. If
  `True`, upon each [`dvclive.next_step()`] call, DVC will prepare an _html
  report_ with all the _metrics logs_ logged in `path`. The _html report_ will
  be located at `{path}.html`.

## Exceptions

- `dvclive.error.DvcLiveError` - If the directory `path` can't be created.
