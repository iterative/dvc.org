# dvclive.init()

Initializes a DVCLive logger.

```py
def init(
    path: str = None,
    resume: bool = False,
    step: int = 0,
    summary: bool = True,
    html: bool = True,
) -> MetricLogger:
```

#### Usage:

```py
import dvclive

dvclive.init()
```

## Description

It's usage is optional and focused on configuring the behavior of subsequent
calls to [`dvclive.log`](log.md) and [`dvclive.next_step`](next_step.md).

⚠️ If `path` already exists when this functions is called, it's contents will be
removed.

## Parameters

- `path` (`dvclive` by default) - The _plot metrics_ (generated by
  [`dvclive.log`](log.md)) will be saved in separated `.tsv` files under `path`
  and the _summary metrics_ (generated by [`dvclive.next_step`](next_step.md))
  will be saved in a single `{path}.json` file.

- `step` (`0` by default) - the `step` values in log files will start
  incrementing from this value.

- `resume` - (`False` by default) - if `True`, DVCLive will try to read the
  previous step from the path dir and start from that point (unless a `step` is
  passed explicitly). [`dvclive.next_step`](next_step.md) calls will increment
  the `step`.

- `summary` (`True` by default) - if `True`, upon each
  [`dvclive.next_step`](next_step.md) call, DVCLive will dump a `.json` file
  containing a summary of all the metrics gathered. The file will be located at
  `{path}.json`.

- `html` (`True` by default) - works only when DVCLive is used alongside DVC. If
  `True`, upon each [`dvclive.next_step`](next_step.md) call, DVC will prepare
  an html report with all the _plot metrics_ logged in `path`.

## Exceptions

- `dvclive.error.DvcLiveError` - If the log dir (`path`) can't be created.
