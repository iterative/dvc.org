# dvclive.init()

Initializes a DVCLive logger.

```py
def init(
    path: str = None,
    resume: bool = False,
    step: int = 0,
    summary: bool = True)
```

#### Usage:

```py
import dvclive

dvclive.init()
```

## Description

It's usage is optional and focused on configuring the behavior of subsequent
calls to `dvclive.log()` and `dvclive.next_step()`.

⚠️ If `path` already exists when this functions is called, a cleanup will remove
all existing DVCLive related files.

## Parameters

- `path` (`dvclive` by default) - Configure where to save _metrics logs_ and
  _metrics summary_ (generated by `dvclive.log()` and `dvclive.next_step()`,
  respectively).

- `step` (`0` by default) - the `step` values in _metrics logs_ files will start
  incrementing from this value (see `dvclive.log()`).

- `resume` - (`False` by default) - if `True`, DVCLive will try to read the
  previous `step` from the `path` directory and start from that point (unless a
  `step`, other than `0`, is passed explicitly).

- `summary` (`True` by default) - if `True`, upon each `dvclive.next_step()`
  call, DVCLive will generate a _metrics summary_ (usable by `dvc metrics`). The
  _summary_ will be located at `{path}.json`.
