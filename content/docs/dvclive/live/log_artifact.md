# Live.log_artifact()

Tracks an existing directory or file with DVC.

```py
def log_artifact(
    path: Union[str, Path],
    type: Optional[str] = None,
    name: Optional[str] = None,
    desc: Optional[str] = None,
    labels: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    meta: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    copy: Optional[bool] = False,
    cache: Optional[bool] = True,
):
```

## Usage

```py
from pathlib import Path
from dvclive import Live

# Create example file
Path("model.pt").write_text("weights")

with Live() as live:
    live.log_artifact(
      "model.pt",
      type="model",
      name="mymodel",
      desc="Fine-tuned Resnet50",
      labels=["resnet", "imagenet"],
    )
```

## Description

Log `path`, saving its contents to DVC storage. Also annotate with any included
metadata fields (for example, to be consumed in the <abbr>model registry</abbr>
or automation scenarios).

If `cache=True` (which is the default), uses `dvc add` to [track] `path` with
DVC, saving it to the DVC <abbr>cache</abbr> and generating a `{path}.dvc` file
that acts as a pointer to the cached data.

If `Live` was initialized with `dvcyaml=True` (which is the default) and you
include any of the optional metadata fields (`type`, `name`, `desc`, `labels`,
`meta`), it will add an <abbr>artifact</abbr> and all the metadata passed as
arguments to the corresponding `dvc.yaml`. Passing `type="model"` will include
it in the <abbr>model registry</abbr>.

## Parameters

- `path` - an existing directory or file.

- `type` - an optional type of the artifact. Common types are `model` or
  `dataset`.

- `name` - an optional custom name of an artifact. If not provided the path stem
  (last part of the path without the file extension) will be used as the
  artifact name.

- `desc` - an optional description of an artifact.

- `labels` - optional labels describing the artifact.

- `meta` - optional metainformation in `key: value` format.

- `copy` - copy a directory or file at `path` into the `dvclive/artifacts`
  location ([default](/doc/dvclive/how-it-works#directory-structure)) before
  tracking it. The new path is used instead of the original one to track the
  artifact. Useful if you don't want to track the original path in your repo
  (for example, it is outside the repo or in a Git-ignored directory).

- `cache` - <abbr>cache</abbr> the files with DVC to [track] them outside of
  Git. Defaults to `True`, but set to `False` if you want to annotate metadata
  about the artifact without storing a copy in the DVC cache.

## Exceptions

- `dvclive.error.InvalidDataTypeError` - thrown if the provided `path` does not
  have a supported type.
