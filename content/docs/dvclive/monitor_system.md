# Monitoring System Metrics

DVCLive can track and log your system metrics so you can see your hardware
performance and limitations during your experiments. The metrics concerns your
GPUs usage, if you have some, and your CPU and RAM memory usage. It can also
monitor the disk usage.

## Usage

To monitor your system metrics you need to install the optional dependencies
first:

```cli
$ pip install "dvclive[system]"
```

Then you can set the `monitor_system` parameter to `True` in `Live`:

```py
from dvclive import Live

live = Live(monitor_system=True)
```

or you can specify additional parameters to configure the logger behavior:

```py
from dvclive import Live
from dvclive.monitor_system import SystemMonitor

live = Live()
live.monitor_system = SystemMonitor(
    interval = 0.01
    num_samples = 20,
    directories_to_monitor = {"data": "/data", "users": "/home"},
    plot = True,
)
```

## Description

The `SystemMonitor` class is used to configure the system logger. If you call
`Live` with `monitor_system=True` it will create a `SystemMonitor` with default
parameters. It works by sampling your system metrics at regular intervals and
average them over a number of samples. The averaged data is then
[logged as a metric](doc/dvclive/live/log_metric).

The `SystemMonitor` has the following parameters:

```py
class SystemMonitor:

    def __init__(
        self,
        interval: float = 0.05,
        num_samples: int = 20,
        directories_to_monitor: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
        plot: bool = True,
        ):
```

- `interval` - the time interval between samples in seconds. To keep the
  sampling interval small, the maximum value allowed is 0.1 seconds. Default to
  0.05.
- `num_samples` - the number of samples to collect before the aggregation. The
  value should be between 1 and 30 samples. Default to 20.
- `directories_to_monitor` - a dictionary with the information about which
  directories to monitor. The `key` would be the name of the metric and the
  `value` is the path to the directory. The metric tracked concerns the
  partition that contains the directory. Default to `{"main": "/"}`.
- `plot` - if `True` it will [log the metric](doc/dvclive/live/log_metric) as a
  plot. The metric will then be available live in [DVC Studio](doc/dvc/studio)
  and in our
  [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iterative.dvc).

The `SystemMonitor` sampling terminates when you call
[`live.end()`](doc/dvclive/live/end).

## List of metrics logged

The `SystemMonitor` logs the following metrics:

### GPUs metrics

If you have GPUs, the following metrics are logged:

- `system/gpu/count` - the number of GPUs available. This metric is not plotted
  since it is not expected to change during an experiment.
- `system/gpu/usage (%)/<gpu_index>` - the average usage of the GPUs in
  percentage.
- `system/vram/usage (%)/<gpu_index>` - the average space used in the virtual
  memory of each GPU, express as percent of the total virtual memory available
  on the GPU.
- `system/vram/usage (GB)/<gpu_index>` - the average space used in the virtual
  memory of each GPU, express as gigabytes.
- `system/vram/total (GB)/<gpu_index>` - the total virtual memory available in
  each GPU, express as gigabytes.

The `<gpu_index>` is the index of the GPU. For example `system/gpu/usage (%)/0`
tracks the usage of the first GPU.

<admon type="tip">

If you have a GPU on your system, but DVCLive doesn't track these metrics,
please check the following conditions for a GPU to be detected:

- Your GPU is supported by
  [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/) and the NVIDIA
  driver is installed.
- You have install the `pynvml` package with with
  `pip install "dvclive[system]"` or with `pip install pynvml`.

</admon>

### CPUs metrics

- `system/cpu/count` - the number of CPU cores available. This metric is not
  plotted since it is not expected to change during an experiment.
- `system/cpu/usage (%)` - the average usage of the CPUs in percentage. This
  metric is the average of all the CPU cores.
- `system/cpu/parallelization (%)` - the average parallelization of the system
  over the CPU cores. This metric is calculated as the ratio between the number
  of CPU cores that are used and the total number of CPU cores available. A core
  is considered used if its activity is greater than 20%.

### RAM metrics

- `system/ram/usage (%)` - the RAM usage in percentage of the total RAM
  capacities.
- `system/ram/usage (GB)` - the RAM usage in gigabytes.
- `system/ram/total (GB)` - the total RAM available in gigabytes. This metric is
  not plotted since it is not expected to change during an experiment.

### Disk metrics

These metrics tracks the disk memory of your system. The directory to monitor
can be specified using the `directories_to_monitor` parameter. The metrics
concern the partition of the disk that contains the directory.

- `system/disk/usage (%)/<name>` - the amount of memory used by the partition in
  percentage.
- `system/disk/usage (GB)/<name>` - the amount of memory used by the partition
  in gigabytes.
- `system/disk/total (GB)/<name>` - the total space available by the partition
  in gigabytes. This metric is not plotted since it is not expected to change
  during an experiment.

The `<name>` is the name of the metric that you specified in the
`directories_to_monitor` parameter. By default, the name is `main`.
