# DVCLive

[`DVCLive`](https://github.com/iterative/dvclive) is an open-source Python
library for monitoring the progress of metrics during training of machine
learning models. You can simply
[install it](https://github.com/iterative/dvclive#installation) with `pip`.

DVCLive integrates seamlessly with `DVC` and the logs/summaries it produces can
be fed as `dvc plots`/`dvc metrics`.

However, `DVC` is not needed to work with DVCLive logs/summaries, and since
they're saved as easily parsable TSV/JSON files, you can use your preferred
visualization method.

We have created DVCLive with Git and MLOps principles in mind:

- **Codification of data**. Tracked metrics are stored in readable text files
  that can be versioned by Git or other version control tools.
- **Distributed**. No services or servers are required. Metrics are stored in a
  Git repository as text files, or pointers to files in `DVC` storage.
- **GitOps API**. logs/summaries are generated through `DVC` using Git commit
  SHAs or branch names, e.g.: `dvc plots diff --targets dvclive`.

- **Automation**. DVCLive logs/summaries are easy to use by any automation,
  DevOps, or MLOps tool such as CI/CD (including
  [CML](https://dvc.org/doc/cml)), custom scripts, or ML platforms.
