# CML is Continuous Machine Learning

[Continuous Machine Learning (CML)](https://cml.dev) is an open-source library
for implementing continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) in machine learning
projects. Use it to automate parts of your development workflow, including model
training and evaluation, comparing ML experiments across your project history,
and monitoring changing datasets.

automatically train and evaluate models, then generates a visual report with
results and metrics. Above, an example report for a
[neural style transfer model](https://rb.gy/ub5idx)._

We built CML with these principles in mind:

- **[GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for data
  science.** Use GitLab or GitHub to manage ML experiments, track who trained ML
  models or modified data and when. Codify data and models with
  [DVC](#using-cml-with-dvc) instead of pushing to a Git repo.
- **Auto reports for ML experiments.** Auto-generate reports with metrics and
  plots in each Git Pull Request. Rigorous engineering practices help your team
  make informed, data-driven decisions.
- **No additional services.** Build your own ML platform using just GitHub or
  GitLab and your favorite cloud services: AWS, Azure, GCP. No databases,
  services or complex setup needed.
