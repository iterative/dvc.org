# Configure

Once you install DVC, you'll be able to start using it (in its local setup)
immediately.

However, remote storage should be set up (see `dvc remote`) if you need to share
data or models outside of the context of a single project, for example with
other collaborators or even with yourself, in a different computing environment.
It's similar to the way you would use GitHub or any other Git server to store
and share your code.

For simplicity, let's setup a local remote:

### What is a "local remote" ?

While the term may seem contradictory, it doesn't have to be. The "local" part
refers to the machine where the project is stored, so it can be any directory
accessible to the same system. The "remote" part refers specifically to the
project/repository itself. Read "local, but external" storage.

```dvc
$ dvc remote add -d myremote /tmp/dvc-storage
$ git commit .dvc/config -m "Configure local remote"
```

> We only use a local remote in this section for simplicity's sake as you learn
> to use DVC. For most [use cases](/doc/use-cases), other "more remote" types of
> remotes will be required.

[Adding a remote](/doc/command-reference/remote/add) should be specified by both
its type (protocol) and its path. DVC currently supports these types of remotes:

- `s3`: Amazon Simple Storage Service
- `azure`: Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
- `gdrive` : Google Drive
- `gs`: Google Cloud Storage
- `ssh`: Secure Shell (requires SFTP)
- `hdfs`: Hadoop Distributed File System
- `http`: HTTP and HTTPS protocols
- `local`: Directory in the local file system

> If you installed DVC via `pip` and plan to use cloud services as remote
> storage, you might need to install these optional dependencies: `[s3]`,
> `[azure]`, `[gdrive]`, `[gs]`, `[oss]`, `[ssh]`. Alternatively, use `[all]` to
> include them all. The command should look like this: `pip install "dvc[s3]"`.
> (This example installs `boto3` library along with DVC to support S3 storage.)

For example, to setup an S3 remote we would use something like this (make sure
that `mybucket` exists):

```dvc
$ dvc remote add -d s3remote s3://mybucket/myproject
```

You can see that DVC doesn't require installing any databases, servers, or
warehouses. It can use bare S3 or SSH to store data, intermediate results, and
models.

See `dvc config` to get information about more configuration options and
`dvc remote` to learn more about remotes and get more examples.
