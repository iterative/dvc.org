# Experiments

Data science process is inherently iterative and R&D like. Data scientist may
try many different approaches, different hyper-parameter values, and "fail" many
times before the required level of a metric is achieved.

DVC is built to provide a way to capture different experiments and navigate
easily between them. Let's say we want to try a modified feature extraction:

Edit `src/featurization.py` to enable bigrams and increase the number of
features. Find and change the `CountVectorizer` arguments, specify `ngram_range`
and increase number of features:

```python
bag_of_words = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english',
                               max_features=6000,
                               ngram_range=(1, 2))
```

```dvc
$ vi src/featurization.py    # edit to use bigrams (see above)
$ dvc repro train.dvc        # regenerate the new model.pkl
$ git commit -am "Reproduce model using bigrams"
```

> Notice that `git commit -a` stages all the changes produced by `dvc repro`
> before committing them with Git. Refer to the
> [command reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--a)
> for more details.

Now, we have a new `model.pkl` captured and saved. To get back to the initial
version, we run `git checkout` along with `dvc checkout` command:

```dvc
$ git checkout baseline-experiment
$ dvc checkout
```

DVC is designed to checkout large data files (no matter how large they are) into
your <abbr>workspace</abbr> almost instantly on almost all modern operating
systems with file links. See
[Large Dataset Optimization](/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization) for
more information.
