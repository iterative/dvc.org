# GTO Documentation

**GTO** (Git Tag Ops) is a tool for creating an Artifact Registry in your Git
repository. An important special case is a
[Machine Learning Model Registry](/doc/use-cases/model-registry).

Such a registry serves as a centralized place to store and operationalize your
artifacts along with their metadata; manage artifact's life-cycle, versions &
releases, and easily automate tests and deployments using GitOps.
