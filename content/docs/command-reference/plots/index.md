## Description

You can visualize and compare JSON, YAML 1.2, CSV, TSV data files or JPEG, GIF,
PNG images found in your project. Typically these are artifacts of an [ML
pipeline] or performance logs produced by [DVCLive].

`dvc plots` subcommands help you customize and generate these plots.

ðŸ“– See [Visualizing Plots] as well as the top-level plots definition
[specification] for more details.
