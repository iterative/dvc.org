# plots

Contains commands to visualize _plot metrics_ in structured files (JSON, CSV, or
TSV): [show](/doc/command-reference/plots/show),
[diff](/doc/command-reference/plots/diff).

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc plots [-h] [-q | -v] {show,diff} ...

positional arguments:
  COMMAND
    show         Generate a plot image file from a metrics file.
    diff         Plot differences in metrics between commits in the
                 DVC repository, or between the last commit and the
                 workspace.
```

## Types of metrics

DVC has two concepts for metrics, that represent different results of machine
learning training or data processing:

1. `dvc metrics` represent **scalar numbers** such as AUC, _true positive rate_,
   etc.
2. `dvc plots` can be used to visualize **data series** such as AUC curves, loss
   functions, confusion matrices, etc.

## Description

DVC provides a set of commands to visualize metrics of machine learning
experiments. Usual plot examples are AUC curves, loss functions, confusion
matrices, among others.

This kind of metric files are created by users, or generated by user data
processing code. `dvc plots` subcommands can work with metric files committed to
a Git repo history, data files controlled by DVC, or any other file in system.

DVC generates plots as HTML files that can be open with a web browser. These
HTML files use [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). Vega is a
declarative grammar for defining plots using JSON. The plots can also be saved
as SVG or PNG image filed from the browser.

In contrast to `dvc metrics`, these metrics should be stored as data series.
Unlike its `dvc metrics` counterpart, `dvc plots diff` cannot calculate numeric
differences between the metrics in different experiments.

### Supported file formats

Continuous metrics can be organized as data series in JSON, CSV, or TSV files.
DVC expects to see an array (or multiple arrays) of objects (usually _float
numbers_) in the file.

In tabular file formats such as CSV and TSV, each column (or field) is an array.
`dvc plots show` can generate visuals for a specified column or a set of
columns. Like `AUC` column:

```
epoch, AUC, loss
34, 0.91935, 0.0317345
35, 0.91913, 0.0317829
36, 0.92256, 0.0304632
37, 0.92302, 0.0299015
```

In hierarchical file formats such as JSON, an array of JSON objects is expected.
`dvc plots show` command can generate visuals for a specified field name or a
set of fields from the array's object. Like `val_loss` field in the `train`
array in this example:

```
{
  "train": [
    {"val_accuracy": 0.9665, "val_loss": 0.10757},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.9764, "val_loss": 0.07324},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8770, "val_loss": 0.08136},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8740, "val_loss": 0.09026},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8795, "val_loss": 0.07640},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8803, "val_loss": 0.07608},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8987, "val_loss": 0.08455}
  ]
}
```

## Plot templates

DVC gives users the ability to change the
[Vega JSON schema](https://github.com/vega/schema), and generate plots in the
format that best fits the their needs. This doesn't make <abbr>DVC
projects</abbr> dependent on user visualization code, programming language, or
specific environments, keeping DVC agnostic.

Built-in _plot templates_ are stored in the `.dvc/plots/` directory. The default
one is called `default.json`. It can be changed with the `--template` (`-t`)
option of `dvc plots show` and `dvc plots diff`. For templates in the
`.dvc/plots/` directory, the path and the json extension are not required: you
can specify only the base name e.g. `--template scatter`.

### Custom templates

Plot template files are just JSON specifications with predefined DVC anchors
that help DVC to inject user's data properly. You can create a custom template
from scratch or modify an existing one from `.dvc/plots/`. Custom templates can
be added to the template directory.

All JSON files given to `dvc plots show` and `dvc plots diff` as input are
combined together into a single data array for the injection to a template file.
There are two important fields that DVC adds to the plot data:

- `index` - self-incrementing, zero-based counter for the data rows/values. In
  many cases it corresponds to a machine learning training epoch or step number.

- `rev` - Git commit hash, tag, or branch of the metrics file. This helps
  distinguish between different versions when using the `dvc plots diff`
  command.

DVC applies the same logic to all CSV/TSV files, but first transforms the data
into JSON. DVC uses column names from a header for JSON conversion into fields.

DVC template anchors:

- `<DVC_METRIC_DATA>` - plotting command input data from either CSV or JSON
  files is converted to JSON array and injected instead of this anchor. Two
  additional fields will be added: `index` and `rev` (explained above).

- `<DVC_METRIC_TITLE>` - a title for the plot, that can be defined by `--title`
  option.

- `<DVC_METRIC_Y>` - a field name for Y axis of the plot. It can be defined by
  `-y` option of the commands. The default field is the last field found in the
  input file: the last column in CSV file or the last field in the JSON array
  object.

- `<DVC_METRIC_X>` - a field name for Y axes. It can be defined by `-x` option.
  `index` is the default field for X.

- `<DVC_METRIC_Y_TITLE>` - a displayed field label for Y.

- `<DVC_METRIC_X_TITLE>` - a displayed field label for X.

## Options

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Example: Tabular data

We'll use tabular metrics file `logs.csv` for this example:

```
epoch,accuracy,loss,val_accuracy,val_loss
0,0.9418667,0.19958884770199656,0.9679,0.10217399864746257
1,0.9763333,0.07896138601688048,0.9768,0.07310650711813942
2,0.98375,0.05241111190887168,0.9788,0.06665669009438716
3,0.98801666,0.03681169906261687,0.9781,0.06697812260198989
4,0.99111664,0.027362171787042946,0.978,0.07385754839298315
5,0.9932333,0.02069501801203781,0.9771,0.08009233058886166
6,0.9945,0.017702101902437668,0.9803,0.07830339228538505
7,0.9954,0.01396906608727198,0.9802,0.07247738889862157
```

Let's plot the last column (default behavior):

```dvc
$ dvc plots show logs.csv
file:///Users/usr/src/plots/logs.csv.html
```

![](/img/plots_show.svg)

Difference in this metric between the current project version and the previous
commit:

```dvc
$ dvc plots diff -d logs.csv HEAD^
file:///Users/usr/src/plots/logs.csv.html
```

![](/img/plots_diff.svg)

Visualize a specific field:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show -y loss logs.csv
file:///Users/usr/src/plots/logs.html
```

![](/img/plots_show_field.svg)

## Example: Confusion matrix

We'll use `classes.csv` for this example:

```csv
actual,predicted
cat,cat
cat,cat
cat,cat
cat,dog
cat,dinosaur
cat,dinosaur
cat,bird
turtle,dog
turtle,cat
...
```

Let's visualize it:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show classes.csv --template confusion -x actual -y predicted
file:///Users/usr/src/plots/classes.csv.html
```

![](/img/plots_show_confusion.svg)

> A confusion matrix [template](/doc/command-reference/plots#plot-templates) is
> predefined in DVC (found in `.dvc/plots/confusion.json`).
