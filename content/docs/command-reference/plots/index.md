# plots

A set of commands to visualize and compare _plot metrics_:
[show](/doc/command-reference/plots/show),
[diff](/doc/command-reference/plots/diff),
[modify](/doc/command-reference/plots/modify) and
[templates](/doc/command-reference/plots/templates).

## Synopsis

```usage

positional arguments:
  COMMAND
    show         Generate plot from a metrics file.
    diff         Plot differences in metrics between commits.
    modify       Modify display properties of data-series plots (has no effect on image-type plots).
    templates    Write built-in plots templates to a directory (.dvc/plots by default).
```

## Types of metrics

DVC has two concepts for metrics, that represent different results of machine
learning training or data processing:

1. `dvc metrics` represent **scalar numbers** such as AUC, _true positive rate_,
   etc.
2. `dvc plots` can be used to visualize **data series** such as AUC curves, loss
   functions, confusion matrices, etc.

## Description

DVC provides a set of commands to visualize certain metrics of machine learning
experiments as plots. Usual plot examples are AUC curves, loss functions,
confusion matrices, among others.

This type of metrics files are created by users, or generated by user data
processing code, and can be defined in `dvc.yaml` (`plots` field) for tracking
(optional).

DVC can work with two types of plots files:

1. Data series files, which can be JSON, YAML, CSV or TSV.
2. Image files in JPEG, GIF, or PNG format.

DVC generates plots as static HTML webpages you can open with a web browser
(they can be saved as SVG or PNG image files from there). You can also visualize
DVC plots from the [VS Code Extension], which includes a special [Plots
Dashboard] that corresponds to the features in the `dvc plots` commands.

Data-series plots utilize [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) for
rendering (declarative JSON grammar for defining graphics). Image-type plots are
rendered using `<img>` tags directly.

## Supported file formats

Image-type plots are included in HTML as-is, without additional processing.

> We recommend to track these source image files with DVC instead of Git, to
> prevent the repository from bloating.

Structured plots can be read from JSON, YAML 1.2, CSV, or TSV files. DVC expects
to see an array (or multiple arrays) of objects (usually _float numbers_) in the
file.

In tabular file formats such as CSV and TSV, each column is an array.
`dvc plots` subcommands can produce plots for a specified column or a set of
them. For example, `epoch`, `AUC`, and `loss` are the column names below:

```
epoch, AUC, loss
34, 0.91935, 0.0317345
35, 0.91913, 0.0317829
36, 0.92256, 0.0304632
37, 0.92302, 0.0299015
```

Hierarchical file formats such as JSON and YAML consists of an array of
consistent objects (sharing a common structure): All objects should contain the
fields used for the X and Y axis of the plot (see
[DVC template anchors](/doc/command-reference/plots#custom-templates)); Extra
elements will be ignored silently.

`dvc plots` subcommands can produce plots for a specified field or a set of
them, from the array's objects. For example, `val_loss` is one of the field
names in the `train` array below:

```json
{
  "train": [
    { "val_accuracy": 0.9665, "val_loss": 0.10757 },
    { "val_accuracy": 0.9764, "val_loss": 0.07324 },
    { "val_accuracy": 0.877, "val_loss": 0.08136 },
    { "val_accuracy": 0.874, "val_loss": 0.09026 },
    { "val_accuracy": 0.8795, "val_loss": 0.0764 },
    { "val_accuracy": 0.8803, "val_loss": 0.07608 },
    { "val_accuracy": 0.8987, "val_loss": 0.08455 }
  ]
}
```

## Plot templates (data series only)

DVC uses [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) JSON specifications to
create plots from user data. A set of built-in _plot templates_ are included.

The `linear` template is the default. It can be changed with the `--template`
(`-t`) option of `dvc plots show` and `dvc plots diff`. The argument provided to
`--template` can be a (built-in) template name or a path to a [custom template].

<admon type="tip">

For templates stored in `.dvc/plots` (default location for custom templates),
the path and the json extension are not required: you can specify only the base
name, e.g. `--template scatter`.

</admon>

DVC has the following built-in plot templates:

- `linear` - basic linear plot including cursor interactivity (default)
- `simple` - simplest linear template (not interactive); Good base to create
  [custom templates].
- `scatter` - scatter plot
- `smooth` - linear plot with LOESS smoothing, see
  [example](/doc/command-reference/plots#example-smooth-plot)
- `confusion` - confusion matrix, see
  [example](/doc/command-reference/plots#example-confusion-matrix)

[custom template]: https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/plots/templates

- `confusion_normalized` - confusion matrix with values normalized to <0, 1>
  range

Note that in the case of CSV/TSV metrics files, column names from the table
header (first row) are equivalent to field names.

### Custom templates

Plot templates are [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) JSON
specifications. They use predefined DVC anchors as placeholders for DVC to
inject the plot values.

- `<DVC_METRIC_DATA>` (**required**) - the plot data from any type of metrics
  files is converted to a single JSON array, and injected instead of this
  anchor. Two additional fields will be added: `step` and `rev` (explained
  below).

- `<DVC_METRIC_TITLE>` (optional) - a title for the plot, that can be defined
  with the `--title` option of the `dvc plots` subcommands.

- `<DVC_METRIC_X>` (optional) - field name of the data for the X axis. It can be
  defined with the `-x` option of the `dvc plots` subcommands. The
  auto-generated `step` field (explained below) is the default.

- `<DVC_METRIC_Y>` (optional) - field name of the data for the Y axis. It can be
  defined with the `-y` option of the `dvc plots` subcommands. It defaults to
  the last header of the metrics file: the last column for CSV/TSV, or the last
  field for JSON/YAML.

- `<DVC_METRIC_X_LABEL>` (optional) - field name to display as the X axis label

- `<DVC_METRIC_Y_LABEL>` (optional) - field name to display as the Y axis label

### Expand to learn how DVC modifies plot data for rendering.

File targets given to `dvc plots show` and `dvc plots diff` are treated as
separate data series, each to be injected into a template file. There are two
important fields that DVC adds to the plot data:

- `step` - zero-based counter for the data rows/values. In many cases it
  corresponds to a machine learning training epoch number.

- `rev` - This field helps distinguish between data sourced from different
  revisions, files or columns.

</details>

Refer to [`templates`](/doc/command-reference/plots/templates) command for more
information on how to prepare your own template from pre-defined ones.

## HTML templates

It's possible to supply an HTML file to `dvc plots show` and `dvc plots diff` by
using the the `--html-template` option. This allows you to customize the
container where DVC will inject plots it generates.

> ⚠️ This is a separate feature from
> [custom Vega-Lite templates](/doc/command-reference/plots#custom-templates).

The only requirement for this HTML file is to specify the place to inject plots
with a `{plot_divs}` marker. See an
[example](/doc/command-reference/plots#example-offline-html-template) that uses
this feature to render DVC plots without an Internet connection, below.

## Options

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Example: Tabular data

We'll use tabular metrics file `logs.csv` for this example:

```
epoch,accuracy,loss,val_accuracy,val_loss
0,0.9418667,0.19958884770199656,0.9679,0.10217399864746257
1,0.9763333,0.07896138601688048,0.9768,0.07310650711813942
2,0.98375,0.05241111190887168,0.9788,0.06665669009438716
3,0.98801666,0.03681169906261687,0.9781,0.06697812260198989
4,0.99111664,0.027362171787042946,0.978,0.07385754839298315
5,0.9932333,0.02069501801203781,0.9771,0.08009233058886166
6,0.9945,0.017702101902437668,0.9803,0.07830339228538505
7,0.9954,0.01396906608727198,0.9802,0.07247738889862157
```

Let's plot the last column (default behavior):

```dvc
$ dvc plots show logs.csv
file:///Users/usr/src/dvc_plots/index.html
```

![](/img/plots_show.svg)

Difference in this metric between the current project version and the previous
commit:

```dvc
$ dvc plots diff HEAD^ --targets logs.csv
file:///Users/usr/src/dvc_plots/index.html
```

![](/img/plots_diff.svg)

Visualize a specific field:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show -y loss logs.csv
file:///Users/usr/src/dvc_plots/index.html
```

![](/img/plots_show_field.svg)

## Example: Smooth plot

In some cases we would like to smooth our plot. In this example we will use a
plot with 1000 data points:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show data.csv
file:///Users/usr/src/dvc_plots/index.html
```

![](/img/plots_show_no_smooth.svg)

We can use the `-t` option and `smooth` template to make it less noisy:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show -t smooth data.csv
file:///Users/usr/src/dvc_plots/index.html
```

![](/img/plots_show_smooth.svg)

## Example: Confusion matrix

We'll use `classes.csv` for this example:

```
actual,predicted
cat,cat
cat,cat
cat,cat
cat,dog
cat,dinosaur
cat,dinosaur
cat,bird
turtle,dog
turtle,cat
...
```

Let's visualize it:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show classes.csv --template confusion -x actual -y predicted
file:///Users/usr/src/dvc_plots/index.html
```

![](/img/plots_show_confusion.svg)

> A confusion matrix [template](/doc/command-reference/plots#plot-templates) is
> predefined in DVC (found in `.dvc/plots/confusion.json`).

## Example: Offline HTML Template

The plots generated by `dvc plots` uses Vega-Lite JavaScript libraries, and by
default these load [online resources](https://vega.github.io/vega/usage/#embed).
There may be times when you need to produce plots without Internet access, or
want to customize the plots output to put some extra content, like banners or
extra text. DVC allows to replace the HTML file that contains the final plots.

Download the Vega-Lite libraries into the directory where you'll produce the
`dvc plots`:

```dvc
$ wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5.20.2 -O my_vega.js
$ wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5.1.0 -O my_vega_lite.js
$ wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6.18.2 -O my_vega_embed.js
```

Create the following HTML file and save it in `.dvc/plots/mypage.html`:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="../path/to/my_vega.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="../path/to/my_vega_lite.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="../path/to/my_vega_embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    {plot_divs}
  </body>
</html>
```

Note that this is a standard HTML file with only `{plot_divs}` as a placeholder
for DVC to inject plots. `<script>` tags in this file point to the local
JavaScript libraries we downloaded above. We can use it like this:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show --html-template .dvc/plots/mypage.html
```

You can also make it the default HTML template by setting it as `dvc config`
parameter `plots.html_template`.

```dvc
$ dvc config plots.html_template plots/mypage.html
```

Note that the path supplied to `dvc config plots.html_template` is relative to
`.dvc/` directory.
