# commit

Record changes to DVC-tracked files in the <abbr>project</abbr>, by updating
[DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories) and saving
<abbr>outputs</abbr> to the <abbr>cache</abbr>.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc commit [-h] [-q | -v] [-f] [-d] [-R]
                  [targets [targets ...]]

positional arguments:
  targets        Limit command scope to these stages or .dvc files.
                 Using -R, directories to search for stages or .dvc
                 files can also be given.
```

## Description

The `dvc commit` command is useful for several scenarios, when data already
tracked by DVC changes: when a [stage](/doc/command-reference/run) or
[pipeline](/doc/command-reference/pipeline) is in development/experimentation;
when manually editing or generating DVC <abbr>outputs</abbr>; or to force
DVC-file updates without reproducing stages or pipelines. These scenarios are
further detailed below.

- Code or data for a stage is under active development, with multiple iterations
  (experiments) in code, configuration, or data. Use the `--no-commit` option of
  DVC commands (`dvc add`, `dvc run`, `dvc repro`) to avoid caching unnecessary
  data repeatedly. Use `dvc commit` when the DVC-tracked data is final.

  ðŸ’¡ For convenience, a pre-commit Git hook is available to remind you to
  `dvc commit` when needed. See `dvc install` for more details.

- It's always possible to manually execute the source code used in a stage
  without DVC (outputs should be unprotected or removed first in certain cases,
  see `dvc unprotect`). Once a desirable result is reached, use `dvc add` or
  `dvc commit` as appropriate to update DVC-files and store changed data to the
  cache.

- Sometimes we want to edit source code, config, or data files in a way that
  doesn't cause changes in the results of their data pipeline. We might write
  add code comments, change indentation, remove some debugging printouts, or any
  other change that doesn't cause changed stage outputs. However, DVC will
  notice that some <abbr>dependencies</abbr> and have changed, and expect you to
  reproduce the whole pipeline. If you're sure no pipeline results would change,
  just use `dvc commit` to force update the related DVC-files and cache.

Let's take a look at what is happening in the first scenario closely. Normally
DVC commands like `dvc add`, `dvc repro` or `dvc run` commit the data to the
<abbr>cache</abbr> after creating a DVC-file. What _commit_ means is that DVC:

- Computes a hash for the file/directory.
- Enters the hash value and file name into the DVC-file.
- Tells Git to ignore the file/directory (adding them to `.gitignore`). (Note
  that if the <abbr>project</abbr> was initialized with no Git support
  (`dvc init --no-scm`), this does not happen.)
- Adds the file/directory to the cache.

There are many cases where the last step is not desirable (for example rapid
iterations on an experiment). The `--no-commit` option prevents the last step
from occurring (on the commands where it's available), saving time and space by
not storing unwanted <abbr>data artifacts</abbr>. The file hash is still
computed and added to the DVC-file, but the actual data file is not saved in the
cache. This is where the `dvc commit` command comes into play. It performs that
last step (saving the data in cache).

Note that it's best to avoid the last two scenarios. They essentially
force-update the [DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories) and save
data to cache. They are still useful, but keep in mind that DVC can't guarantee
reproducibility in those cases.

## Options

- `-d`, `--with-deps` - determines files to commit by tracking dependencies to
  the target DVC-files (stages). If no `targets` are provided, this option is
  ignored. By traversing all stage dependencies, DVC searches backward from the
  target stages in the corresponding pipelines. This means DVC will not commit
  files referenced in later stages than the `targets`.

- `-R`, `--recursive` - determines the files to commit by searching each target
  directory and its subdirectories for DVC-files to inspect. If there are no
  directories among the `targets`, this option is ignored.

- `-f`, `--force` - commit data even if hash values for dependencies or outputs
  did not change.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information from executing the
  `dvc add` command.

## Examples

Let's employ a simple <abbr>workspace</abbr> with some data, code, ML models,
pipeline stages, such as the <abbr>DVC project</abbr> created for the
[Get Started](/doc/tutorials/get-started). Then we can see what happens with
`git commit` and `dvc commit` in different situations.

### Click and expand to setup the project

Start by cloning our example repo if you don't already have it:

```dvc
$ git clone https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started
$ cd example-get-started
```

Now let's install the requirements. But before we do that, we **strongly**
recommend creating a
[virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments):

```dvc
$ virtualenv -p python3 .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

Download the precomputed data using:

```dvc
$ dvc pull --all-branches --all-tags
```

## Example: Rapid iterations

Sometimes we want to iterate through multiple changes to configuration, code, or
data, trying different ways to improve the output of a stage. To avoid filling
the <abbr>cache</abbr> with undesired intermediate results, we can run a single
stage with `dvc run --no-commit`, or reproduce an entire pipeline using
`dvc repro --no-commit`. This prevents data from being pushed to cache. When
development of the stage is finished, `dvc commit` can be used to store data
files in the cache.

In the `featurize.dvc` stage, `src/featurize.py` is executed. A useful change to
make is adjusting a parameter to `CountVectorizer` in that script. Namely,
adjusting the `max_features` value in the line below changes the resulting
model:

```python
bag_of_words = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english',
            max_features=6000, ngram_range=(1, 2))
```

This edit introduces a change that would cause the `featurize.dvc`, `train.dvc`
and `evaluate.dvc` stages to execute if we ran `dvc repro`. But if we want to
try several values for `max_features` and save only the best result to the
cache, we can run it like this:

```dvc
$ dvc repro --no-commit evaluate.dvc
```

We can run this command as many times as we like, editing `featurize.py` any way
we like, and so long as we use `--no-commit`, the data does not get saved to the
cache. Let's verify that's the case:

First verification:

```dvc
$ dvc status

evaluate.dvc:
    changed deps:
        modified:           data/features
        modified:           model.pkl
train.dvc:
    changed outs:
        not in cache:       model.pkl
```

Now we can look in the cache directory to see if the new version of `model.pkl`
is indeed _not in cache_ as claimed. Look at `train.dvc` first:

```yaml
cmd: python src/train.py data/features model.pkl
deps:
  - md5: d05e0201a3fb47c878defea65bd85e4d
    path: src/train.py
  - md5: b7a357ba7fa6b726e615dd62b34190b4.dir
    path: data/features
md5: b91b22bfd8d9e5af13e8f48523e80250
outs:
  - cache: true
    md5: 70599f166c2098d7ffca91a369a78b0d
    metric: false
    path: model.pkl
    persist: false
wdir: .
```

To verify this instance of `model.pkl` is not in the cache, we must know the
path to the cached file. In the cache directory, the first two characters of the
hash value are used as a subdirectory name, and the remaining characters are the
file name. Therefore, had the file been committed to the cache, it would appear
in the directory `.dvc/cache/70`. Let's check:

```dvc
$ ls .dvc/cache/70
ls: .dvc/cache/70: No such file or directory
```

If we've determined the changes to `featurize.py` were successful, we can
execute this set of commands:

```dvc
$ dvc commit
$ dvc status
Data and pipelines are up to date.
$ ls .dvc/cache/70
599f166c2098d7ffca91a369a78b0d
```

We've verified that `dvc commit` has saved the changes into the cache, and that
the new instance of `model.pkl` is there.

## Example: Running commands without DVC

It is also possible to execute the commands that are executed by `dvc repro` by
hand. You won't have DVC helping you, but you have the freedom to run any
command you like, even ones not defined in a
[DVC-file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories). For example:

```dvc
$ python src/featurization.py data/prepared data/features
$ python src/train.py data/features model.pkl
$ python src/evaluate.py model.pkl data/features auc.metric
```

As before, `dvc status` will show which files have changed, and when your work
is finalized `dvc commit` will commit everything to the <abbr>cache</abbr>.

## Example: Updating dependencies

Sometimes we want to clean up a code or configuration file in a way that doesn't
cause a change in its results. We might write in-line documentation with
comments, change indentation, remove some debugging printouts, or any other
change that doesn't produce different output of pipeline stages.

```dvc
$ git status -s
M src/train.py

$ dvc status

train.dvc:
    changed deps:
        modified:           src/train.py
```

Let's edit one of the source code files. It doesn't matter which one. You'll see
that both Git and DVC recognize a change was made.

If we ran `dvc repro` at this point, this pipeline would be reproduced. But
since the change was inconsequential, that would be a waste of time and CPU.
That's especially critical if the corresponding stages take lots of resources to
execute.

```dvc
$ git add src/train.py

$ git commit -m "CHANGED"
[master 72327bd] CHANGED
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

$ dvc commit
dependencies ['src/train.py'] of 'train.dvc' changed.
Are you sure you commit it? [y/n] y

$ dvc status

Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

Instead of reproducing the pipeline for changes that do not produce different
results, just use `commit` on both Git and DVC.
