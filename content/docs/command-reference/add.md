## Description

DVC allows tracking datasets using `.dvc` files as lightweight pointers to your
data. The `dvc add` command is used to track and update your data by creating or
updating `.dvc` files.

With `dvc add`, you can seamlessly track datasets, models or large files by
specifying the targets you want to track. DVC manages the corresponding `.dvc`
files, ensuring the consistency of your data to your workspace.

The `targets` can be individual files, directories, or specific paths within an
already tracked dataset. For new files and
[directories](#adding-entire-directories) that are not currently tracked, DVC
creates new `.dvc` files to track the added data, and stores them in the
<abbr>cache</abbr>.

If the target is a part of an existing dataset, only that portion of the dataset
is updated, and associated `.dvc` file is updated to reflect the changes. If the
target path does not exist in workspace but was previously tracked, it will be
removed from the dataset, and the `.dvc` file will be updated accordingly.

Leveraging the metadata in `.dvc` files and the <abbr>cache</abbr> structure,
datasets don't need to exist completely in your workspace to update. You can
pull a dataset partially and operate on it. DVC will automatically update the
relevant `.dvc` file to reflect the changes. This capability allows you to
[work with large datasets without having to download the entire dataset](/docs/user-guide/data-management/modifying-large-datasets#modifying-remote-datasets)
to your local machine.

This command can be used to track large files, models, dataset directories, etc.
that are too big for Git to handle directly. This enables
[versioning](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-models) them indirectly with
Git.

> See also `dvc.yaml` and `dvc stage add` for more advanced ways to track and
> version intermediate and final results (like ML models).

The command will add the `targets` to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being
committed to the Git repository (unless `dvc init --no-scm` was used when
initializing the <abbr>DVC project</abbr>). The generated `.dvc` files can be
staged automatically if [`core.autostage`] is set.

[`core.autostage`]: /doc/user-guide/project-structure/configuration#core

To exclude specific files or directories from being added, you can add
corresponding patterns to a `.dvcignore` file.

You can also [undo `dvc add`](/doc/user-guide/how-to/stop-tracking-data) to stop
tracking files or directories.

By default, DVC tries to use reflinks (see
[File link types](/doc/user-guide/data-management/large-dataset-optimization#file-link-types-for-the-dvc-cache)
to avoid copying any file contents and to optimize `.dvc` file operations for
large files. DVC also supports other link types for use on file systems without
`reflink` support, but they have to be specified manually. Refer to the
`cache.type` config option in `dvc config cache` for more information.

### Adding entire directories

A `dvc add` target can be either a file or a directory. In the latter case, a
`.dvc` file is created for the top of the hierarchy (with default name
`<dir_name>.dvc`).

Every file in the dir is cached normally (unless the `--no-commit` option is
used), but DVC does not produce individual `.dvc` files for each one. Instead,
the single `.dvc` file references a special JSON file in the cache (with `.dir`
extension), that in turn points to the added files.

> Refer to
> [Structure of cache directory](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/internal-files#structure-of-the-cache-directory)
> for more info. on `.dir` cache entries.

Note that DVC commands that use tracked data support granular targeting of files
and directories, even when contained in a parent directory added as a whole.
Examples: `dvc push`, `dvc pull`, `dvc get`, `dvc import`, etc.

To avoid adding files inside a directory accidentally, you can add the
corresponding patterns to `.dvcignore`.

### Adding symlink targets {#add-symlink}

`dvc add` supports symlinked files as `targets`. But if a target path is a
directory symlink, or if it contains any intermediate directory symlinks, it
cannot be added to DVC.

For example, given the following project structure:

```
.
├── .dvc
├── dir
│   └── file
├── link_to_dir -> dir
├── link_to_external_dir -> /path/to/dir
├── link_to_external_file -> /path/to/file
└── link_to_file -> dir/file
```

`link_to_file` and `link_to_external_file` are both valid symlink targets to
`dvc add`. But `link_to_dir`, `link_to_external_dir`, and `link_to_dir/file` are
not.

## Options

- `--no-commit` - do not store `targets` in the cache (the `.dvc` file is still
  created). Use `dvc commit` to finish the operation (similar to `git commit`
  after `git add`).

- `--glob` - allows adding files and directories that match the [pattern]
  specified in `targets`. Shell style wildcards supported: `*`, `?`, `[seq]`,
  `[!seq]`, and `**`

- `-o <path>`, `--out <path>` - specify a `path` to the desired location in the
  workspace to place the `targets` (copying them from their current location).
  This enables targeting data outside the project.

- `--to-remote` - add a target that's outside the project, neither move it into
  the workspace, nor cache it.
  [Transfer it](#example-transfer-to-remote-storage) directly to remote storage
  instead (the default one unless otherwise specified with `-r`). Implies
  `--out .`. Use `dvc pull` to get the data locally.

- `-r <name>`, `--remote <name>` - name of the `dvc remote` to transfer external
  target to (can only be used with `--to-remote`).

- `--remote-jobs <number>` - parallelism level for DVC to transfer data when
  using `--to-remote`. The default value is `4 \* cpu_count()`. For SSH remotes,
  the default is `4`. Using more jobs may speed up the operation.

- `-f`, `--force` - when using `--out` to specify a local target file or
  directory, the operation will fail if those paths already exist. this flag
  will force the operation causing local files/dirs to be overwritten by the
  command.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Example: Single file

Track a file with DVC:

```cli
$ dvc add data.xml
```

As indicated above, a `.dvc` file has been created for `data.xml`. Let's explore
the result:

```cli
$ tree
.
├── data.xml
└── data.xml.dvc
```

Let's check the `data.xml.dvc` file inside:

```yaml
outs:
  - md5: 6137cde4893c59f76f005a8123d8e8e6
    path: data.xml
```

This is a standard `.dvc` file with only one output (`outs` field). The hash
value (`md5` field) corresponds to a file path in the <abbr>cache</abbr>.

```cli
$ file .dvc/cache/files/md5/d8/acabbfd4ee51c95da5d7628c7ef74b
.dvc/cache/files/md5/61/37cde4893c59f76f005a8123d8e8e6: ASCII text
```

⚠️ Tracking compressed files (e.g. ZIP or TAR archives) is not recommended, as
`dvc add` supports tracking directories (details below).

## Example: Directory

Let's suppose your goal is to build an algorithm to identify cats and dogs in
pictures. You may then have hundreds or thousands of pictures of these animals
in a directory, and this is your training dataset:

```cli
$ tree pics --filelimit 3
pics
├── train
│   ├── cats [many image files]
│   └── dogs [many image files]
└── validation
    ├── cats [more image files]
    └── dogs [more image files]
```

[Tracking a directory](#tracking-directories) with DVC as simple as with a
single file:

```cli
$ dvc add pics
```

There are no `.dvc` files generated within this directory structure to match
each image, but the image files are all <abbr>cached</abbr>. A single `pics.dvc`
file is generated for the top-level directory, and it contains:

```yaml
outs:
  - md5: ce57450aa92ab8f2b957c24b0df73edc.dir
    path: pics
```

> Refer to [Adding entire directories](#adding-entire-directories) for more
> info.

This allows us to treat the entire directory structure as a single data
artifact. For example, you can pass it as a <abbr>dependency</abbr> to a stage
definition:

```cli
$ dvc stage add -n train \
                -d train.py -d pics \
                -M metrics.json -o model.h5 \
                python train.py
```

> To try this example, see the
> [versioning tutorial](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-models/tutorial).

## Example .dvcignore

Let's take an example to illustrate how `.dvcignore` interacts with `dvc add`.

```cli
$ mkdir dir
$ echo file_one > dir/file1
$ echo file_two > dir/file2
```

Now add `file1` to `.dvcignore` and track the entire `dir` directory with
`dvc add`.

```cli
$ echo dir/file1 > .dvcignore
$ dvc add dir
```

Let's now modify `file1` (which is listed in `.dvcignore`) and run `dvc status`:

```cli
$ echo file_one_changed > dir/file1
$ dvc status
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

`dvc status` ignores changes to files listed in `.dvcignore`.

Let's have a look at cache directory:

```cli
$ tree .dvc/cache/files/md5
.dvc/cache/files/md5
├── 0a
│   └── ec3a687bd65c3e6a13e3cf20f3a6b2.dir
└── 52
    └── 4bcc8502a70ac49bf441db350eafc2
```

Only the hash values of the `dir/` directory (with `.dir` file extension) and
`file2` have been cached.

## Example: Transfer to remote storage

Sometimes there's not enough space in the local environment to import a large
dataset, but you still want to track it in the <abbr>project</abbr> so that
`dvc pull` can download it later.

As long as you have setup a `dvc remote` that can handle the data, this can be
achieved with the `--to-remote` flag. It creates a `.dvc` file without
downloading anything, transferring a target directly to remote storage instead.

Let's add a `data.xml` file via HTTP straight "to remote":

```cli
$ dvc add https://data.dvc.org/get-started/data.xml --to-remote
...
$ ls
data.xml.dvc
```

Since a `.dvc` file is created in the <abbr>workspace</abbr>, whenever anyone
wants to actually download the data they can use `dvc pull`:

```cli
$ dvc pull data.xml.dvc
A       data.xml
1 file added
```

<admon type="info">

Note that you can also do this [with `dvc import-url`]. This has the added
benefit of keeping a connection to the data source so it can be updated later
(with `dvc update`).
