# add

Track data files or directories with DVC, by creating a corresponding
[`.dvc` file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#dvc-files).

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc add [-h] [-q | -v] [-R] [--no-commit] [--external]
               [-f <filename>] targets [targets ...]

positional arguments:
  targets               Files or directories to add
```

## Description

The `dvc add` command is analogous to `git add`, in that it makes DVC aware of
the target data, in order to start versioning it. It creates a
[`.dvc` file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#dvc-files) to track the
added data.

This command can be used to
[version control](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files) large files,
models, dataset directories, etc. that are too big for Git.

The `targets` are the files or directories to add, which are turned into
<abbr>data artifacts</abbr> of the <abbr>project</abbr>. These are stored in the
<abbr>cache</abbr> by default (use the `--no-commit` option to avoid this, and
`dvc commit` to finish the process when needed).

> See also `dvc run` for more advanced ways to version intermediate and final
> results (like ML models).

After checking that each `target` file (or directory) hasn't been added before
(or tracked with other DVC commands), a few actions are taken under the hood for
each one:

1. Calculate the file hash.
2. Move the file contents to the cache (by default in `.dvc/cache`), using the
   file hash to form the cached file path. (See
   [Structure of cache directory](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#structure-of-cache-directory)
   for more details.)
3. Attempt to replace the file with a link to the cached data (more details on
   file linking further down).
4. Create a corresponding
   [`.dvc` file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#dvc-files) to track
   the file, using its path and hash to identify the cached data. The `.dvc`
   file lists the DVC-tracked file as an <abbr>output</abbr> (`outs` field).
   Unless the `-f` option is used, the `.dvc` file name generated by default is
   `<file>.dvc`, where `<file>` is the file name of the first target.
5. Add the `targets` to `.gitignore` in order to prevent them from being
   committed to the Git repository (unless `dvc init --no-scm` was used when
   initializing the DVC project).
6. Instructions are printed showing `git` commands for adding the files, if
   appropriate.

Summarizing, the result is that the target data is replaced by small
[`.dvc` files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#dvc-files) that can be
easily tracked with Git.

> Note that `.dvc` files can be considered _orphan stages_, because they have no
> <abbr>dependencies</abbr>, only outputs. These are treated as _always changed_
> by `dvc status` and `dvc repro`, which always executes them. See
> [`dvc.yaml`](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#dvcyaml-file) to learn
> more about stages.

To avoid adding files inside a directory accidentally, you can add the
corresponding [patterns](/doc/user-guide/dvcignore) in a `.dvcignore` file.

By default, DVC tries to use reflinks (see
[File link types](/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization#file-link-types-for-the-dvc-cache)
to avoid copying any file contents and to optimize `.dvc` file operations for
large files. DVC also supports other link types for use on file systems without
`reflink` support, but they have to be specified manually. Refer to the
`cache.type` config option in `dvc config cache` for more information.

### Tracking directories

A `dvc add` target can be an individual file or a directory. In the latter case,
a [`.dvc` file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#dvc-files) is created
for the top of the directory (with default name `<dir_name>.dvc`).

Every file in the hierarchy is added to the cache (unless the `--no-commit`
option is used), but DVC does not produce individual `.dvc` files for each file
in the directory tree. Instead, the single `.dvc` file references a special JSON
file in the cache (with `.dir` extension), that in turn points to the added
files.

Note that DVC commands that use tracked files support granular targeting of
files, even when the directory is added as a whole. Examples: `dvc push`,
`dvc pull`, `dvc get`, `dvc import`, etc.

As a rarely needed alternative, the `--recursive` option causes every file in
the hierarchy to be added individually. A corresponding `.dvc` file will be
generated for each file in he same location. This may be helpful to save time
adding several data files grouped in a structural directory, but it's
undesirable for data directories with a large number of files.

## Options

- `-R`, `--recursive` - determines the files to add by searching each target
  directory and its subdirectories for data files. If there are no directories
  among the `targets`, this option is ignored. For each file found, a new `.dvc`
  file is created using the process described in this command's description.

- `--no-commit` - do not save outputs to cache. A `.dvc` file is created and an
  entry is added to `.dvc/state`, while nothing is added to the cache.
  (`dvc status` will report that the file is `not in cache`.) Use `dvc commit`
  when ready to commit outputs with DVC. This is analogous to using `git add`
  before `git commit`.

- `-f <filename>`, `--file <filename>` - specify name of the `.dvc` file it
  generates. This option works only if there is a single target. By default the
  name of the generated `.dvc` file is `<target>.dvc`, where `<target>` is the
  file name of the given target. This option allows to set the name and the path
  of the generated `.dvc` file.

- `--external` - allow `targets` that are outside of the DVC repository. See
  [Managing External Data](/doc/user-guide/managing-external-data).

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Example: Single file

Track a file with DVC:

```dvc
$ dvc add data.xml
...

To track the changes with git, run:

        git add .gitignore data.xml.dvc
```

As indicated above, a
[`.dvc` file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#dvc-files) has been
created for `data.xml`. Let's explore the result:

```dvc
$ tree
.
├── data.xml
└── data.xml.dvc
```

Let's check the `data.xml.dvc` file inside:

```yaml
outs:
  - md5: 6137cde4893c59f76f005a8123d8e8e6
    path: data.xml
```

This is a standard `.dvc` file with only one output (`outs` field). The hash
value (`md5` field) corresponds to a file path in the <abbr>cache</abbr>.

```dvc
$ file .dvc/cache/d8/acabbfd4ee51c95da5d7628c7ef74b
.dvc/cache/61/37cde4893c59f76f005a8123d8e8e6: ASCII text
```

⚠️ Note that tracking compressed files (e.g. ZIP or TAR archives) is not
recommended, as `dvc add` supports tracking directories (details below).

## Example: Directory

Let's suppose your goal is to build an algorithm to identify cats and dogs in
pictures. You may then have hundreds or thousands of pictures of these animals
in a directory, and this is your training dataset:

```dvc
$ tree pics --filelimit 3
pics
├── train
│   ├── cats [many image files]
│   └── dogs [many image files]
└── validation
    ├── cats [more image files]
    └── dogs [more image files]
```

Tracking a directory with DVC as simple as with a single file:

```dvc
$ dvc add pics
```

There are no [`.dvc` files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#dvc-files)
generated within this directory structure to match each image, but the image
files are all <abbr>cached</abbr>. A single `pics.dvc` file is generated for the
top-level directory, and it contains:

```yaml
outs:
  - md5: ce57450aa92ab8f2b957c24b0df73edc.dir
    path: pics
```

> Refer to
> [Structure of cache directory](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories#structure-of-cache-directory)
> for more info.

This allows us to treat the entire directory structure as a single <abbr>data
artifact</abbr>. For example, you can pass the whole directory tree as a
<abbr>dependency</abbr> to a `dvc run` stage definition:

```dvc
$ dvc run -n train \
          -d train.py -d pics \
          -M metrics.json -o model.h5 \
          python train.py
```

> To try this example, see the [Versioning](/doc/tutorials/versioning) tutorial.

If instead we use the `--recursive` (`-R`) option, the output looks like this:

```dvc
$ dvc add -R pics
```

In this case, a `.dvc` file is generated for each file in the `pics/` directory
tree:

```dvc
$ tree pics
pics
├── train
|   ├── cats
|   |   ├── img1.jpg
|   |   ├── img1.jpg.dvc
|   |   ├── img2.jpg
|   |   ├── img2.jpg.dvc
|   |   ├── ...
|   └── dogs
|       ├── img1.jpg
|       ├── img1.jpg.dvc
|       ...
```

Note that no top-level `.dvc` file is generated, which is typically less
convenient. For example, we cannot use the directory structure as one unit with
`dvc run` or other commands.

## Example: Dvcignore

Let's take an example to illustrate how `.dvcignore` interacts with `dvc add`.

```dvc
$ mkdir dir
$ echo file_one > dir/file1
$ echo file_two > dir/file2
```

Now add `file1` to `.dvcignore` and track the entire `dir` directory with
`dvc add`.

```dvc
$ echo dir/file1 > .dvcignore
$ dvc add dir
```

Let's now modify `file1` (which is listed in `.dvcignore`) and run `dvc status`:

```dvc
$ echo file_one_changed > dir/file1
$ dvc status
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

`dvc status` ignores changes to files listed in `.dvcignore`.

Let's have a look at cache directory:

```dvc
$ tree .dvc/cache
.dvc/cache
├── 0a
│   └── ec3a687bd65c3e6a13e3cf20f3a6b2.dir
└── 52
    └── 4bcc8502a70ac49bf441db350eafc2
```

Only the hash values of the `dir/` directory (with `.dir` file extension) and
`file2` have been cached.

See [Dvcignore](/doc/user-guide/dvcignore) for more details.
