# checkout

Update data files and directories in the <abbr>workspace</abbr> based on current
DVC-files.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc checkout [-h] [-q | -v] [--summary] [-d] [-R] [-f]
                    [--relink] [targets [targets ...]]

positional arguments:
  targets        Limit command scope to these stages or .dvc files.
                 Using -R, directories to search for stages or .dvc
                 files can also be given.
```

## Description

`.dvc` and `dvc.lock` [files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-files-and-directories) act as
pointers to specific version of data files or directories tracked by DVC. This
command synchronizes the workspace data with the versions specified in the
current `.dvc` and `dvc.lock` files.

`dvc checkout` is useful, for example, when using Git in the
<abbr>project</abbr>, after `git clone`, `git checkout`, or any other operation
that changes the DVC files in the workspace.

ðŸ’¡ For convenience, a Git hook is available to automate running `dvc checkout`
after `git checkout`. See the
[Automating example](#example-automating-dvc-checkout) below or `dvc install`
for more details.

The execution of `dvc checkout` does the following:

- Scans the `.dvc` and `dvc.lock` files to compare against the data files or
  directories in the <abbr>workspace</abbr>. DVC knows which data
  (<abbr>outputs</abbr>) match because the corresponding hash values are saved
  in the `outs` fields in those files. Scanning is limited to the given
  `targets` (if any). See also options `--with-deps` and `--recursive` below.

- Missing data files or directories are restored from the <abbr>cache</abbr>.
  Those that don't match with any DVC-file are removed. See options `--force`
  and `--relink`. A list of the changes done is printed.

By default, this command tries not make copies of cached files in the workspace,
using reflinks instead when supported by the file system (refer to
[File link types](/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization#file-link-types-for-the-dvc-cache)).
The next linking strategy default value is `copy` though, so unless other file
link types are manually configured in `cache.type` (using `dvc config`), files
will be copied. Keep in mind that having file copies doesn't present much of a
negative impact unless the project uses very large data (several GBs or more).
But leveraging file links is crucial with large files, for example when checking
out a 50Gb file by copying might take a few minutes whereas, with links,
restoring any file size will be almost instantaneous.

> When linking files takes longer than expected (10 seconds for any one file)
> and `cache.type` is not set, a warning will be displayed reminding users about
> the faster link types available. These warnings can be turned off setting the
> `cache.slow_link_warning` config option to `false` with `dvc config cache`.

This command will fail to checkout files that are missing from the cache. In
such a case, `dvc checkout` prints a warning message. It also lists the partial
progress made by the checkout.

There are two methods to restore a file missing from the cache, depending on the
situation. In some cases a pipeline must be reproduced (using `dvc repro`) to
regenerate its outputs (see also `dvc pipeline`). In other cases the cache can
be pulled from remote storage using `dvc pull`.

## Options

- `--summary` - display a short summary of the changes done by this command in
  the workspace, instead of a full list of changes.

- `-R`, `--recursive` - determines the files to checkout by searching each
  target directory and its subdirectories for DVC-files to inspect. If there are
  no directories among the `targets`, this option is ignored.

- `-d`, `--with-deps` - determines files to update by tracking dependencies to
  the target DVC-files (stages). If no `targets` are provided, this option is
  ignored. By traversing all stage dependencies, DVC searches backward from the
  target stages in the corresponding pipelines. This means DVC will not checkout
  files referenced in later stages than the `targets`.

- `-f`, `--force` - does not prompt when removing workspace files. Changing the
  current set of DVC-files with `git checkout` can result in the need for DVC to
  remove files that don't match those DVC-file references or are missing from
  cache. (They are not "committed", in DVC terms.)

- `--relink` - ensures the file linking strategy (`reflink`, `hardlink`,
  `symlink`, or `copy`) for all data in the workspace is consistent with the
  project's [`cache.type`](/doc/command-reference/config#cache). This is
  achieved by restoring **all data files or a directories** referenced in
  current DVC-files (regardless of whether they match a current DVC-file).

- `-h`, `--help` - shows the help message and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information from executing the
  `dvc pull` command.

## Examples

Let's employ a simple <abbr>workspace</abbr> with some data, code, ML models,
pipeline stages, such as the <abbr>DVC project</abbr> created for the
[Get Started](/doc/tutorials/get-started). Then we can see what happens with
`git checkout` and `dvc checkout` as we switch from tag to tag.

<details>

### Click and expand to setup the project

Start by cloning our example repo if you don't already have it:

```dvc
$ git clone https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started
$ cd example-get-started
$ dvc fetch -aT
```

We run `dvc fetch` with the `-aT` flags to get the DVC-tracked data from all Git
branches and tags from [remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote) to the
<abbr>cache</abbr>. This way it's all available for the `checkout` examples
below.

</details>

The workspace looks like this:

````dvc
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ data.xml.dvc
â”œâ”€â”€ dvc.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ dvc.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ params.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ prc.json
â”œâ”€â”€ scores.json
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ evaluate.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ featurization.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ prepare.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
    â””â”€â”€ train.py```
````

This repository includes the following tags, that represent different variants
of the resulting model:

```dvc
$ git tag
...
baseline-experiment     <- First simple version of the model
bigrams-experiment      <- Uses bigrams to improve the model
```

We can now just run `dvc checkout` that will update the most recent `model.pkl`,
`data.xml`, and other files that are tracked by DVC. The model file hash is
defined in the `dvc.lock` file, and in the `data.xml.dvc` file for the
`data.xml`:

```dvc
$ dvc checkout

$ md5 model.pkl
MD5 (data.xml) = ab349c2b5fa2a0f66d6f33f94424aebe
```

What if we want to "rewind history", so to speak? The `git checkout` command
lets us restore any point in the repository history, including any tags. It
automatically adjusts the files, by replacing file content and adding or
deleting files as necessary.

```dvc
$ git checkout baseline-experiment  # Stage where model is first created
```

Let's check the hash value of `model.pkl` in `dvc.lock` now:

```yaml
outs:
  - path: model.pkl
    md5: 98af33933679a75c2a51b953d3ab50aa
```

But if you check `model.pkl`, the file hash is still the same:

```dvc
$ md5 model.pkl
MD5 (model.pkl) = ab349c2b5fa2a0f66d6f33f94424aebe
```

This is because `git checkout` changed `dvc.lock` and other DVC files. But it
did nothing with the `model.pkl` and `matrix.pkl` files. Git doesn't track those
files; DVC does, so we must do this:

```dvc
$ dvc checkout
M       model.pkl
M       data\features\

$ md5 model.pkl
MD5 (model.pkl) = 98af33933679a75c2a51b953d3ab50aa
```

What happened is that DVC went through the DVC-files and adjusted the current
set of <abbr>output</abbr> files to match the `outs` in them.

## Example: Automating DVC checkout

We want the data files or directories (managed by DVC) to match with the other
files (managed by Git e.g. source code). This requires us to remember running
`dvc checkout` when needed after a `git checkout`, and we may not always
remember to do so. Wouldn't it be nice to automate this?

```dvc
$ dvc install
```

`dvc install` installs Git hooks to automate common operations, including
running `dvc checkout` when needed.

(Having followed the previous example) we can then checkout the master branch
again:

```dvc
$ git checkout bigrams-experiment  # Has the latest model version

$ md5 model.pkl
MD5 (model.pkl) = ab349c2b5fa2a0f66d6f33f94424aebe
```

Previously this took two commands, `git checkout` followed by `dvc checkout`. We
can now skip the second one, which is automatically run for us. The workspace is
automatically synchronized accordingly.
