# gc

Remove unused files and directories from <abbr>cache</abbr> or
[remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote).

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc gc [-h] [-q | -v]
              [-w] [-a] [-T] [--all-commits] [-c] [-r <name>]
              [-f] [-j <number>] [-p [<path> [<path> ...]]]
```

## Description

This command deletes (garbage collects) data files or directories that exist in
DVC cache but are no longer needed. With `--cloud` it also removes data in
[remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote).

To avoid accidentally deleting data, it raises an error and doesn't touch any
files if no scope options are provided. It means it's user's responsibility to
explicitly provide the right set of options to specify what data is still needed
(so that DVC can figure out what files can be safely deleted).

One of the scope options (`--workspace`, `--all-branches`, `--all-tags`,
`--all-commits`) or a combination of them must be provided. Each of them
corresponds to keeping the data for the current workspace, and for a certain set
of commits (determined by reading the DVC-files in them). See the
[Options](#options) section for more details.

> Note that `dvc gc` tries to fetch any missing
> [`.dir` files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-internals#structure-of-the-cache-directory)
> from [remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote) to the local
> <abbr>cache</abbr>, in order to determine which files should exist inside
> cached directories. These files may be missing if the cache directory was
> previously garbage collected, in a newly cloned copy of the repo, etc.

Unless the `--cloud` option is used, `dvc gc` does not remove data files from
any remote. This means that any files collected from the local cache can be
restored using `dvc fetch`, as long as they have previously been uploaded with
`dvc push`.

### Removing data in remote storage

If `--cloud` option is provided, command deletes unused data not only in local
DVC cache, but also in remote storage. It means it can be dangerous since in
most cases removing data locally and in remote storage is irreversible.

The default remote is cleaned (see `dvc config core.remote`) unless the
`--remote` option is used.

## Options

- `-w`, `--workspace` - keep _only_ files and directories referenced in the
  workspace. Note that this behavior is implied in `--all-tags`,
  `--all-branches`, and `--all-commits`.

- `-a`, `--all-branches` - keep cached objects referenced in all Git branches,
  and in the workspace (implying `-w`). Useful if branches are used to track
  different experiments. Note that this can be combined with `-T` below, for
  example using the `-aT` flag.

- `-T`, `--all-tags` - same as `-a` above, but applies to all Git tags, and in
  the workspace (implying `-w`). Useful if tags are used to track "checkpoints"
  of an experiment or project. Note that both options can be combined, for
  example using the `-aT` flag.

- `--all-commits` - same as `-a` or `-T` above, but applies to all Git commits,
  and in the workspace (implying `-w`). This preserves the cache for all data
  used in the entire commit history of the project.

  A use case for this option is to safely delete all temporary data `dvc run`
  and/or `dvc repro` cache when used without committing changes (see the `-O` or
  `-M`, and `--no-commit` options in those commands). In that scenario, data
  that is never referenced from the workspace or from any Git commit can still
  be stored in the project's cache).

- `-p <paths>`, `--projects <paths>` - if a single remote or a single cache is
  shared among different projects (e.g. a configuration like the one described
  [here](/doc/use-cases/shared-development-server)), this option can be used to
  specify a list of them (each project is a path) to keep data that is currently
  referenced from them.

- `-c`, `--cloud` - remove files in remote storage in addition to local cache.
  **This option is dangerous.** The default remote is used unless a specific one
  is given with `-r`.

- `-r <name>`, `--remote <name>` - name of the
  [remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote) to collect unused objects from
  if `-c` option is specified (see `dvc remote list`).

- `-j <number>`, `--jobs <number>` - parallelism level for DVC to access data
  from remote storage. This only applies when the `--cloud` option is used, or a
  `--remote` is given. The default value is `4 * cpu_count()`. For SSH remotes,
  the default is `4`. Note that the default value can be set using the `jobs`
  config option with `dvc remote modify`. Using more jobs may speed up the
  operation.

  > For now only some phases of garbage collection are parallel.

- `-f`, `--force` - force garbage collection. Skip confirmation prompt.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

Basic example of cleaning up the <abbr>cache</abbr>:

```dvc
$ du -sh .dvc/cache/
7.4G    .dvc/cache/
```

When you run `dvc gc --workspace`, DVC removes all objects from cache that are
not referenced in the <abbr>workspace</abbr> (by collecting hash values from the
DVC-files):

```dvc
$ dvc gc --workspace

'.dvc/cache/27e30965256ed4d3e71c2bf0c4caad2e' was removed
'.dvc/cache/2e006be822767e8ba5d73ebad49ef082' was removed
'.dvc/cache/2f412200dc53fb97dcac0353b609d199' was removed
'.dvc/cache/541025db4da02fcab715ca2c2c8f4c19' was removed
'.dvc/cache/62f8c2ba93cfe5a6501136078f0336f9' was removed
'.dvc/cache/7c4521365288d69a03fa22ad3d399f32' was removed
'.dvc/cache/9ff7365a8256766be8c363fac47fc0d4' was removed
'.dvc/cache/a86ca87250ed8e54a9e2e8d6d34c252e' was removed
'.dvc/cache/f64d65d4ccef9ff9d37ea4cf70b18700' was removed
```

Let's check the size now:

```dvc
$ du -sh .dvc/cache/
3.1G    .dvc/cache/
```
