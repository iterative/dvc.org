# import-url

Download a file or directory from a supported URL (for example `s3://`,
`ssh://`, and other protocols) into the <abbr>workspace</abbr>, and track
changes in the remote data source. Creates a
[`.dvc` file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format).

> See `dvc import` to download and tack data/model files or directories from
> other <abbr>DVC repositories</abbr> (e.g. hosted on Github).

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc import-url [-h] [-q | -v] [-f <filename>] url [out]

positional arguments:
  url                   (See supported URLs in the description.)
  out                   Destination path to put files in.
```

## Description

In some cases it's convenient to add a data file or directory from a remote
location into the workspace, such that it can be updated later, if/when the
external data source changes. Example scenarios:

- A remote system may produce occasional data files that are used in other
  projects.
- A batch process running regularly updates a data file to import.
- A shared dataset on a remote storage that is managed and updated outside DVC.

> Note that `dvc get-url` corresponds to the first step this command performs
> (just download the file or directory).

The `dvc import-url` command helps the user create such an external data
dependency without having to manually copying files from the supported remote
locations (listed below), which may require installing a different tool for each
type.

The `url` argument specifies the external location of the data to be imported,
while `out` can be used to specify the directory and/or file name desired for
the downloaded data. If an existing directory is specified, the file or
directory will be placed inside.

[`.dvc` files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) support references to data in an
external location, see
[External Dependencies](/doc/user-guide/external-dependencies). In such a `.dvc`
file, the `deps` field stores the remote URL, and the `outs` field contains the
corresponding local path in the <abbr>workspace</abbr>. It records enough
metadata about the imported data to enable DVC efficiently determining whether
the local copy is out of date.

DVC supports several types of (local or) remote locations (protocols):

| Type     | Description                                         | `url` format                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `local`  | Local path                                          | `/path/to/local/data`                      |
| `s3`     | Amazon S3                                           | `s3://mybucket/data`                       |
| `azure`  | Microsoft Azure Blob Storage                        | `azure://my-container-name/path/to/data`   |
| `gs`     | Google Cloud Storage                                | `gs://mybucket/data`                       |
| `ssh`    | SSH server                                          | `ssh://user@example.com:/path/to/data`     |
| `hdfs`   | HDFS to file (explanation below)                    | `hdfs://user@example.com/path/to/data.csv` |
| `http`   | HTTP to file with _strong ETag_ (explanation below) | `https://example.com/path/to/data.csv`     |
| `remote` | Remote path (see explanation below)                 | `remote://myremote/path/to/data`           |

> If you installed DVC via `pip` and plan to use cloud services as remote
> storage, you might need to install these optional dependencies: `[s3]`,
> `[azure]`, `[gdrive]`, `[gs]`, `[oss]`, `[ssh]`. Alternatively, use `[all]` to
> include them all. The command should look like this: `pip install "dvc[s3]"`.
> (This example installs `boto3` library along with DVC to support S3 storage.)

Specific explanations:

- HDFS and HTTP **do not** support downloading entire directories, only single
  files.

- In case of HTTP,
  [strong ETag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag#Strong_and_weak_validation)
  is necessary to track if the specified remote file (URL) changed to download
  it again.

- `remote://myremote/path/to/file` notation just means that a DVC
  [remote](/doc/command-reference/remote) `myremote` is defined and when DVC is
  running. DVC automatically expands this URL into a regular S3, SSH, GS, etc
  URL by appending `/path/to/file` to the `myremote`'s configured base path.

Another way to understand the `dvc import-url` command is as a short-cut for a
more verbose `dvc run` command. This is discussed in the
[External Dependencies](/doc/user-guide/external-dependencies) documentation,
where an alternative is demonstrated for each of these schemes.

Instead of:

```dvc
$ dvc import-url https://example.com/path/to/data.csv data.csv
```

It is possible to instead use `dvc run`, for example (HTTP URL):

```dvc
$ dvc run -d https://example.com/path/to/data.csv \
          -o data.csv \
          wget https://example.com/path/to/data.csv -O data.csv
```

`dvc import-url` generates an import stage
[`.dvc` file](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) and `dvc run` a regular stage (in
[`dvc.yaml`](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format)). Both have an external
dependency, but the one created by `dvc import-url` preserves the connection to
the data source. We call this an _import stage_.

Note that import stages are considered always
[frozen](/doc/command-reference/freeze), meaning that if you run `dvc repro`,
they won't be updated. Use `dvc update` on them to bring the import up to date
from the external data source.

## Options

- `-f <filename>`, `--file <filename>` - specify a path and/or file name for the
  `.dvc` file created by this command (e.g. `-f stages/stage.dvc`). This
  overrides the default file name: `<file>.dvc`, where `<file>` is the desired
  file name of the imported data (`out`).

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

To illustrate these examples we will be using the <abbr>project</abbr> explained
in the [Get Started](/doc/tutorials/get-started).

### Click and expand to setup example

Start by cloning our example repo if you don't already have it. Then move into
the repo and checkout the
[2-remote](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started/releases/tag/2-remote)
tag, corresponding to the [Configure](/doc/tutorials/get-started#configure)
section of the _Get Started_:

```dvc
$ git clone https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started
$ cd example-get-started
$ git checkout 2-remote
$ mkdir data
```

You should now have a blank <abbr>workspace</abbr>, just before
[Versioning Basics](/doc/tutorials/get-started/data-versioning).

## Example: Tracking a remote file

An advanced alternate to the intro of the
[Versioning Basics](/doc/tutorials/get-started/data-versioning) part of the _Get
Started_ is to use `dvc import-url`:

```dvc
$ dvc import-url https://data.dvc.org/get-started/data.xml \
                 data/data.xml
Importing 'https://data.dvc.org/get-started/data.xml' -> 'data/data.xml'
...
To track the changes with git, run:

	git add data.xml.dvc data/.gitignore
```

Let's take a look at the resulting stage file (`.dvc` file) `data.xml.dvc`:

```yaml
md5: 61e80c38c1ce04ed2e11e331258e6d0d
wdir: .
deps:
  - etag: '"f432e270cd634c51296ecd2bc2f5e752-5"'
    path: https://data.dvc.org/get-started/data.xml
outs:
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: data/data.xml
    cache: true
    metric: false
    persist: false
```

The `etag` field in the `.dvc` file contains the
[ETag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) recorded from the HTTP request.
If the remote file changes, its ETag will be different. This metadata allows DVC
to determine whether its necessary to download it again.

> See [DVC-File Format](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) for more details on the
> text format above.

You may want to get out of and remove the `example-get-started/` directory after
trying this example (especially if trying out the following one).

## Example: Detecting remote file changes

What if that remote file is updated regularly? The project goals might include
regenerating some results based on the updated data source.
[Pipeline](/doc/command-reference/pipeline) reproduction can be triggered based
on a changed external dependency.

Let's use the [Get Started](/doc/tutorials/get-started) project again,
simulating an updated external data source. (Remember to prepare the
<abbr>workspace</abbr>, as explained in [Examples](#examples))

To illustrate this scenario, let's use a local file system directory (external
to the workspace) to simulate a remote data source location. (In real life, the
data file will probably be on a remote server.) Run these commands:

```dvc
$ mkdir /tmp/dvc-import-url-example
$ cd /tmp/dvc-import-url-example/
$ wget https://data.dvc.org/get-started/data.xml
$ cd -  # to go back to the project
```

In a production system, you might have a process to update data files. That's
not what we have here, so in this case we'll set up a "data store" where we can
edit the data file.

```dvc
$ dvc import-url /tmp/dvc-import-url-example/data.xml data/data.xml
Importing '../../../tmp/dvc-import-url-example/data.xml' -> 'data/data.xml'
```

Check `data.xml.dvc`:

```yaml
md5: eca0a296d67781cc488c6ffd1cc63b8e
wdir: .
deps:
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: /tmp/dvc-import-url-example/data.xml
outs:
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: data/data.xml
    cache: true
    metric: false
    persist: false
```

The `.dvc` file is nearly the same as in the previous example. The difference is
that the dependency (`deps`) now references the local file in the data store
directory we created previously. (Its `path` has the URL for the data store.)
And instead of an `etag` we have an `md5` hash value. We did this so its easy to
edit the data file.

Let's now manually reproduce the
[data processing part](/doc/tutorials/get-started/data-pipelines) of the _Get
Started_ project. Download the example source code archive and unzip it:

```dvc
$ wget https://code.dvc.org/get-started/code.zip
$ unzip code.zip
$ rm -f code.zip
```

<details>

### Click and expand to setup the environment

Let's install the requirements. But before we do that, we **strongly** recommend
creating a
[virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments):

```dvc
$ virtualenv -p python3 .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

</details>

```dvc
$ dvc run -f prepare.dvc \
          -d src/prepare.py -d data/data.xml \
          -o data/prepared \
          python src/prepare.py data/data.xml
Running command:
	python src/prepare.py data/data.xml
...
$ tree
.
├── data
│   ├── data.xml
│   └── prepared
│       ├── test.tsv
│       └── train.tsv
├── data.xml.dvc
├── prepare.dvc
├── requirements.txt
└── src
    ├── evaluate.py
    ├── featurization.py
    ├── prepare.py
    └── train.py

3 directories, 10 files
```

At this point, DVC considers everything being up to date:

```dvc
$ dvc status
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

In the data store directory, edit `data.xml`. It doesn't matter what you change,
as long as it remains a valid XML file, because any change will result in a
different dependency file hash (`md5`) in the import stage `.dvc` file. Once we
do so, we can run `dvc update` to make sure the import stage is up to date:

```dvc
$ dvc update data.xml.dvc
...
Importing '.../tmp/dvc-import-url-example/data.xml' -> 'data/data.xml'
```

DVC notices the "external" data source has changed, and updates the import stage
(reproduces it). In this case it's also necessary to run `dvc repro` so that the
remaining pipeline results are also regenerated:

```dvc
$ dvc status
prepare.dvc:
	changed deps:
		modified:           data/data.xml

$ dvc repro prepare.dvc
...
Reproducing 'prepare.dvc'
...

$ dvc status
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

`dvc repro` executes the command defined in the given `prepare.dvc` stage after
noticing that its dependency `data/data.xml` has changed. `dvc status` should
report "Data and pipelines are up to date" after this.
