tasks.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc queue kill [-h] [-q | -v] [<task> ...]

positional arguments:
  <task>         Tasks in queue to kill.
```

## Description

Forcefully stops execution of the specified (running) experiment tasks. Killed
tasks will be considered as failed runs.

This command does not stop the queue worker process. After the specified task
has been killed, the worker process will consume and execute the next experiment
task in the queue.

To kill all running experiment tasks and also stop queue processing, you can use
`dvc queue stop --kill`.

<admon type="warn">

Note that killed experiment tasks will be considered failed runs and will not be
re-added to the queue for future execution.

</admon>
