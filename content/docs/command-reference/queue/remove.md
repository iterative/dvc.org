## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc queue remove [-h] [-q | -v]
                        [--all] [--queued] [--success] [--failed]
                        [<task> ...]

positional arguments:
  <task>         Tasks in queue to remove.
```

## Description

Removes the specified queued or completed experiment `task`(s) from the queue.
For completed tasks, this will also remove any associated output logs.

<admon type="warn">

Note that for successfully completed tasks, this command is not the same as
`dvc exp remove`, because `dvc queue remove` does not remove any data associated
with an experiment, only the queue entry and any output logs for that task.

</admon>
