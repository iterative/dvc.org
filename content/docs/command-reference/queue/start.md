## queue start

Start the
[DVC experiments](/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/experiments-overview)
task queue worker process.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc queue start [-h] [-q | -v] [-j <number>]
```

## Description

Starts one or more task queue worker processes. Each worker process will consume
and execute one queued experiment task at a time in the background, until either
`dvc queue stop` is used or the queue is empty.

<admon type="info">

Due to [internal limitations], when the queue is empty a worker may be idle for
up to 10 seconds before exiting. If new experiment tasks are added to the queue
during this time, the idle worker will resume processing them instead.

[internal limitations]:
  /doc/user-guide/experiment-management/running-experiments#how-are-experiments-queued

</admon>

Queued experiment tasks are run sequentially by default, but can be run in
parallel by using the `--jobs` option to start more than one worker.

<admon type="warn">

Parallel runs are experimental and may be unstable. Make sure you're using
number of jobs that your environment can handle (no more than the CPU cores).

Note that since queued experiments are run isolated from each other, common
stages may sometimes be executed several times depending on the state of the
<abbr>run-cache</abbr> at that time.

</admon>

## Options

- `-j <number>`, `--<number>` - start up to this number of workers in parallel.
  Defaults to 1 (the task queue is processed serially).

  <admon type="info">

  Note that if any queue worker processes have already been started, this
  command will not start additional processes unless `number` is greater than
  the number of existing workers (`number` is treated as the maximum allowed
  concurrency value).

  If `number` is less than the number of existing worker processes, this command
  will not stop any existing worker processes. To reduce worker concurrency,
  `dvc queue stop` must first be used to stop queue processing, before running
  `dvc queue run` with the desired number of `--jobs`.

  </admon>

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.
