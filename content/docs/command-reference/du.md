## Description

Produces a view of a <abbr>DVC repository</abbr> (usually online), listing the
contents of a repository alongside the disk usage of the objects.

This command's output is equivalent to [listing](/doc/command-reference/list)
the repo but includs also the size the object use on disk.

This is usefull to check if there is enough space on your locak disk before
[pulling](/doc/command-reference/pull) a repository.

Only the total disk usage is displayed when you set the `-s` option.

## Options

- `-s`, `--summarize` - displays only a total disk usage.

- `-H`, `--human-readable` - displays disk usage in human readable form.

- `--dvc-only` - show only DVC-tracked files and directories
  (<abbr>outputs</abbr>).

- `--rev <commit>` - commit hash, branch or tag name, etc. (any
  [Git revision](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions)) of the repository to list
  content for. The latest commit in `master` (tip of the default branch) is used
  by default when this option is not specified.
- `--show-json` - prints the command's output in easily parsable JSON format,
  instead of a human-readable table.
