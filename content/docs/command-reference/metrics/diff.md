# metrics diff

Compare [metrics](/doc/command-reference/metrics) between two commits in the
<abbr>DVC repository</abbr>, or between a commit and the <abbr>workspace</abbr>.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc metrics diff [-h] [-q | -v]
                        [--targets [<paths> [<paths> ...]]] [-R]
                        [--all] [--show-json] [--show-md] [--no-path]
                        [--old] [--precision <n>]
                        [a_rev] [b_rev]

positional arguments:
  a_rev                 Old Git commit to compare (defaults to HEAD)
  b_rev                 New Git commit to compare (defaults to the
                        current workspace)
```

## Description

This command provides a quick way to compare metrics among experiments in the
repository history. The differences shown by this command include the new value,
and numeric difference (delta) from the previous value of metrics (rounded to 5
digits precision).

`a_rev` and `b_rev` are Git commit hashes, tag, or branch names. If none are
specified, `dvc metrics diff` compares metrics currently present in the
<abbr>workspace</abbr> (uncommitted changes) with the latest committed versions
(required). A single specified revision results in comparing the workspace and
that version.

All metrics defined in `dvc.yaml` are used by default, but specific metrics
files can be specified with the `--targets` option

> Note that targets don't necessarily have to be defined in `dvc.yaml`. For that
> reason, this command doesn't require an existing DVC project to run in; It
> works in any Git repo.

Another way to display metrics is the `dvc metrics show` command, which just
lists all the current metrics, without comparisons.

## Options

- `--targets <paths>` - specific metrics files to compare. It accepts `paths` to
  any valid metrics file, regardless of whether `dvc.yaml` is currently tracking
  any metrics in them. Using `-R`, directories to search metrics files in can
  also be given.

  When specifying arguments for `--targets` before `revisions`, you should use
  `--` after this option's arguments (POSIX terminals), e.g.:

  ```dvc
  $ dvc metrics diff --targets t1.json t2.yaml -- HEAD v1
  ```

- `-R`, `--recursive` - determines the metrics files to use by searching each
  target directory and its subdirectories for DVC-tracked files to inspect. If
  there are no directories among the `targets`, this option is ignored.

- `--all` - list all metrics, including those without changes.

- `--show-json` - prints the command's output in easily parsable JSON format,
  instead of a human-readable table.

- `--show-md` - prints the command's output in Markdown table format.

- `--old` - show old metric value in addition to the new value.

- `--no-path` - don't show metric path in the result table. This option is
  useful when only one metrics file is in use or there is no intersection
  between the metric names.

- `--precision <n>` -
  [round](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round) metrics to `n`
  digits precision after the decimal point. Rounds to 5 digits by default.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

Start by creating a metrics file and commit it (see the `-M` option of `dvc run`
for more details):

```dvc
$ dvc run -n eval -M metrics.json \
          'echo {"AUC": 0.9643, "TP": 527} > metrics.json'

$ cat metrics.json
{"AUC": 0.9643, "TP": 527}

$ git add dvc.* metrics.json
$ git commit -m "Add metrics file"
```

Now let's simulate a change in our AUC metric:

```dvc
$ echo '{"AUC":0.9671, "TP":531}' > metrics.json

$ git diff
...
-{"AUC":0.9643, "TP":527}
+{"AUC":0.9671, "TP":531}
```

To see the change, let's run `dvc metrics diff`. This compares our current
<abbr>workspace</abbr> (including uncommitted local changes) metrics to what we
had in the previous commit:

```dvc
$ dvc metrics diff
Path          Metric    Value    Change
metrics.json  AUC       0.9671   0.0028
metrics.json  TP        531      4
```

## Example: compare metrics among specific versions

Metrics files committed with Git can be compared by referencing the commits (any
two [revisions](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions)):

```dvc
$ dvc metrics diff --targets metrics.json -- HEAD c7bef55
Path       Metric    Value    Change
eval.json  ACU       0.66729  0.01614
eval.json  TP        516      -12
```
