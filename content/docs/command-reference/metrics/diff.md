# metrics diff

Show changes in [project metrics](/doc/command-reference/metrics), between
commits in the <abbr>DVC repository</abbr>, or between a commit and the
<abbr>workspace</abbr>.

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc metrics diff [-h] [-q | -v]
                        [--targets [<path> [<path> ...]]]
                        [-t <type>] [-x <path>] [-R] [--show-json]
                        [a_ref] [b_ref]

positional arguments:
  a_rev                 Old Git commit to compare (defaults to HEAD)
  b_rev                 New Git commit to compare (defaults to the
                        current workspace)
```

## Description

This command means to provide a quick way to compare results from your previous
experiments with the current results of your pipeline, as long as you're using
metrics that DVC is aware of (see `dvc metrics add`). Run without arguments,
this command compares all existing metric files currently present in the
<abbr>workspace</abbr> (uncommitted changes) with the latest committed version.

The differences shown by this command include the new value, and numeric
difference (delta) from the previous value of metrics (with 3-digit accuracy).
They're calculated between two commits (hash, branch, tag, or any
[Git revision](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions)) for all metrics in the
<abbr>project</abbr>, found by examining all of the
[DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) in both references.

## Options

- `--targets <paths>` - limit the comparison to these specific metric files.

- `-R`, `--recursive` - determines the metric files to use by searching each
  target directory and its subdirectories for DVC-files to inspect. If there are
  no directories among the `targets`, this option is ignored.

- `-t <type>`, `--type <type>` - specify a type of the metric file. Accepted
  values are: `raw` (default), `json`, `tsv`, `htsv`, `csv`, `hcsv`. It will be
  used to determine how to parse and format metics for display. See
  `dvc metrics show` for more details.

  This option will override `type` and `xpath` defined in the corresponding
  DVC-file. If no `type` is provided or found in the DVC-file, DVC will try to
  detect it based on file extension.

- `-x <path>`, `--xpath <path>` - specify a path within a metric file to show
  changes for a specific metric value only. Should be used if the metric file
  contains multiple numbers and you want to use only one of them. Only a single
  path is allowed. It will override `xpath` defined in the corresponding
  DVC-file. See `dvc metrics show` for more details.

- `--show-json` - prints the command's output in easily parsable JSON format,
  instead of a human-readable table.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

Let's employ a simple <abbr>workspace</abbr> with some data, code, ML models,
pipeline stages, such as the <abbr>DVC project</abbr> created in our
[Get Started](/doc/get-started) section. Then we can see what happens with
`dvc install` in different situations.

### Click and expand to setup the project

Start by cloning our example repo if you don't already have it:

```dvc
$ git clone https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started
$ cd example-get-started
```

</details>

Notice that we have an `auc.metric` metric file:

```
$ cat auc.metric
0.602818
```

Now let's mock a change in our AUC metric:

```
$ echo '0.5' > auc.metric
```

To see the change, let's run `dvc metrics diff`. This compares our current
<abbr>workspace</abbr> (including uncommitted local changes) metrics to what we
had in the previous commit:

```
$ git diff
--- a/auc.metric
+++ b/auc.metric
@@ -1 +1 @@
-0.602818
+0.5

$ dvc metrics diff
   Path      Metric   Value   Change
auc.metric            0.500   -0.103
```

> Note that metric files are typically versioned with Git, so we can use both
> `git diff` and `dvc metrics diff` to understand their changes, as seen above.
