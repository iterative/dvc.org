## Description

_Stages_ represent individual data processes, including their input and
resulting outputs. They can be combined to capture simple data workflows,
organize data science projects, or build detailed machine learning pipelines.

`dvc stage add` can be used to create/update stages in the `dvc.yaml` file. Use
`dvc stage list` or `dvc dag` to discover existing stages without having to
examine `dvc.yaml` files manually.
