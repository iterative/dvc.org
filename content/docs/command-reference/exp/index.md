## Description

`dvc exp` subcommands provide specialized ways to create and manage data
science/ machine learning experiments.

📖 See [Experiment Management](/doc/user-guide/experiment-management) for more
info.

> ⚠️ Note that DVC assumes that experiments are deterministic (see **Avoiding
> unexpected behavior** in `dvc stage add`).

## Options

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.
