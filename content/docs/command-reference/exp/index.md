## Description

`dvc exp` subcommands provide specialized ways to create and manage data science
experiments. The basic workflow goes like this:

- Modify <abbr>dependencies</abbr> (e.g. input data or source code),
  <abbr>parameters</abbr>, or commands (`cmd` field of `dvc.yaml`) of committed
  stages.
- Use `dvc exp run` (instead of `repro`) to execute the pipeline. This puts the
  experiment's results in your <abbr>workspace</abbr>, and tracks it under the
  hood.
- Visualize experiment configurations and results with `dvc exp show`. Repeat.
- Use [metrics](/doc/command-reference/metrics) in your pipeline to identify the
  best experiment(s), and promote them to persistent experiments (regular
  commits) with `dvc exp apply`.

üìñ See [Experiment Management](/doc/user-guide/experiment-management) for more
info.

> Note that DVC assumes that <abbr>experiments</abbr> are deterministic (see
> **Avoiding unexpected behavior** in `dvc run`).

## Options

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.
