```

## Description

Provides a way to execute and track <abbr>experiments</abbr> in your
<abbr>project</abbr> without polluting it with unnecessary commits, branches,
directories, etc.

`dvc exp run` has the same general behavior as `dvc repro` when it comes to
`targets` and stage execution (restores the dependency graph, etc.).

<admon type="info">

This includes committing any changed data <abbr>dependencies</abbr> to the
<abbr>DVC cache</abbr> when preparing the experiment, which can take some time.
See the [Options](#options) section for the differences.

</admon>

Use the `--set-param` (`-S`) option as a shortcut to change
<abbr>parameter</abbr> values [on-the-fly] before running the experiment.

It's possible to [queue experiments] for later execution with the `--queue`
flag. Queued experiments can be run with `dvc queue start` and managed with
other `dvc queue` commands.

It's also possible to run special [checkpoint experiments] that log the
execution progress (useful for deep learning ML). The `--rev` and `--reset`
options have special uses for these.

<admon type="info">

See the [Running Experiments] guide for more details on all these features.

</admon>

[Review] your experiments with `dvc exp show`. Successful ones can be [made
persistent] by restoring them via `dvc exp branch` or `dvc exp apply` and
committing them to the Git repo. Unnecessary ones can be [cleared] with
`dvc exp gc`.

## Options

> In addition to the following, `dvc exp run` accepts the options in `dvc repro`
> except for `--glob`, `--no-commit`, and `--no-run-cache`.

- `-S [<filename>:]<override_pattern>`,
  `--set-param [<filename>:]<override_pattern>` - set the value of existing
  `dvc params` for this experiment. `filename` can be any valid params file
  (`params.yaml` by default). This will override the param file before running
  the experiment.

  For example, to override the value an existing param, you can use
  `--set-param <param_name>=<param_value>`.

  Valid `<override_pattern>` values are defined in the
  [Hydra Override Grammar](https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/#modifying-the-config-object).
  Patterns modifying Hydra's defaults list are not supported.

- `-n <name>`, `--name <name>` - specify a [unique name] for this experiment. A
  default one will be generated otherwise, such as `exp-f80g4` (based on the
  experiment's hash).

- `--temp` - run this experiment outside your workspace (in `.dvc/tmp/exps`).
  Useful to continue working (e.g. in another terminal) while a long experiment
  runs.

- `--queue` - place this experiment at the end of a line for future execution,
  but don't actually run it yet. Use `dvc queue start` to process the queue.

  > For checkpoint experiments, this implies `--reset` unless a `--rev` is
  > provided.

- `--run-all` - run all queued experiments (see `--queue`) and outside your
  workspace (in `.dvc/tmp/exps`). Use `-j` to execute them
  [in parallel](#queueing-and-parallel-execution).

  <admon type="warn">

  `dvc exp run --run-all [--jobs]` is now a shortcut for
  `dvc queue start [--jobs]` followed by `dvc queue logs -f`. The `--run-all`
  and `--jobs` options will be deprecated in a future DVC release.

  </admon>

- `-j <number>`, `--jobs <number>` - run this `number` of queued experiments in
  parallel. Only has an effect along with `--run-all`. Defaults to 1 (the queue
  is processed serially).

- `-r <commit>`, `--rev <commit>` - resume an experiment from a specific
  checkpoint name or hash (`commit`) in `--queue` or `--temp` runs.

- `--reset` - deletes `checkpoint: true` outputs before running this experiment
  (regardless of `dvc.lock`). Useful for ML model re-training.

- `-f`, `--force` - reproduce pipelines even if no changes were found (same as
  `dvc repro -f`).

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if all
  stages are up to date or if all stages are successfully executed, otherwise
  exit with 1. The command defined in the stage is free to write output
  regardless of this flag.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

### Expand to prepare the example ML project

Clone the DVC repo and download the data it <abbr>depends</abbr> on:

```dvc
$ git clone git@github.com:iterative/example-get-started.git
$ cd example-get-started
$ dvc pull
```

Let's also install the Python requirements:

> We **strongly** recommend creating a
> [virtual environment](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/library/venv.html)
> first.

```dvc
$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

</details>

Let's check the latest metrics of the project:

```dvc
$ dvc metrics show
Path         avg_prec    roc_auc
scores.json  0.60405     0.9608
```

For this experiment, we want to see the results for a smaller dataset input, so
let's limit the data to 20 MB and reproduce the pipeline with `dvc exp run`:

```dvc
$ truncate --size=20M data/data.xml
$ dvc exp run
...
Reproduced experiment(s): exp-44136
Experiment results have been applied to your workspace.

$ dvc metrics diff
Path         Metric    HEAD     workspace  Change
scores.json  avg_prec  0.60405  0.56103    -0.04302
scores.json  roc_auc   0.9608   0.94003    -0.02077
```

The `dvc metrics diff` command shows the difference in performance for the
experiment we just ran (`exp-44136`).

## Example: Modify parameters on-the-fly

`dvc exp run --set-param` (`-S`) saves you the need to manually edit the params
file before running an experiment. It can override (`train.epochs=10`), append
(`+train.weight_decay=0.01`), or remove (`~model.dropout`) parameters.

<admon type="tip">

DVC supports the
[Hydra Override Grammar](https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/),
with the exception of patterns that modify Hydra's defaults list.

</admon>

You can optionally provide a prefix `[<filename>:]` in order to edit a specific
`dvc params` file. If not provided, `params.yaml` will be used as default.

```dvc
$ dvc exp run -S train_config.json:+train.weight_decay=0.001
...
```

```dvc
$ dvc params diff
Path              Param               HEAD    workspace
train_config.json  train.weight_decay  -       0.001
```

<admon type="warn">

Note that `exp run --set-param` (`-S`) doesn't update your `dvc.yaml`. When
appending or removing <abbr>parameters</abbr>, make sure to update the
[`params` section](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/project-structure/dvcyaml-files#parameters)
of your `dvc.yaml` accordingly.
