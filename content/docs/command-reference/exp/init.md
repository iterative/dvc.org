# exp init

Quickly create or prepare any project to use [DVC Experiments].

```

## Description

This command helps you get started with DVC Experiments quickly. It reduces
repetitive DVC procedures by creating a `dvc.yaml` file. It assumes standard
locations of your inputs (data, <abbr>parameters</abbr>, and source code) and
outputs (models, <abbr>metrics</abbr>, and
[plots](/doc/command-reference/plots)).

The only required argument is a [shell `command`] to run your experiment(s). It
can be provided directly as an argument (see example below) or by using the
`--interactive` (`-i`) mode, which will prompt for it.

```cli
$ dvc exp init "python src/train.py"
Creating dependencies: src, data and params.yaml
Creating output directories: plots and models
Creating train stage in dvc.yaml
```

`dvc exp init` also generates the boilerplate project structure, including input
files/directories and directories needed for future outputs. These locations can
also be customized via [CLI options](#options) or interactive mode, or with
[configuration](/doc/command-reference/config#exp). Default structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”œâ”€â”€ dvc.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ metrics.json
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”œâ”€â”€ params.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ plots/
â””â”€â”€ src/
```

Inside `dvc.yaml`, the experiment is wrapped as a <abbr>stage</abbr> that
`dvc exp run` can execute.

<admon type="tip">

A special `--type` of stage is supported (`checkpoint`), which monitors
[checkpoints] during training of ML models.

ðŸ“– `dvc exp init` is intended as a quick way to start running [DVC Experiments].
See the [Pipelines guide] for more on that topic.

## Options

- `-i`, `--interactive` - prompts user for a command that runs your
  experiment(s) (see [details](#the-command-argument)) and to confirm or define
  the paths that conform your repo's structure.

- `-n <stage>`, `--name <stage>` - specify a custom name for the stage generated
  by this command. The default is `train`. It can only contain letters, numbers,
  dash `-` and underscore `_` (same as `dvc stage add --name`).

- `--run` - automatically run the experiment after creating the stage (same as
  `dvc exp run`).

- `--type` - selects the type of the stage to create. Currently it provides two
  alternatives: `checkpoint` (supports logging
  [checkpoints](/doc/command-reference/exp/run#checkpoints) during model
  training) and `default` (no need to specify this).

- `--code` - set the path to the file or directory where the source code that
  your experiment depends on can be found (if any). Overrides other
  configuration and default value (`src/`).

- `--params` - set the path to the file or directory where the
  </abbr>parameters</abbr> that your experiment depends on can be found.
  Overrides other configuration and default value (`params.yaml`).

- `--data` - set the path to the data file or directory that your experiment
  depends on can be found (if any). Overrides other configuration and default
  value (`data/`).

- `--models` - set the path to the file or directory where the model(s) produced
  by your experiment can be found (if any). Overrides other configuration and
  default value (`models/`).

  > ðŸ’¡ This could be used for any artifacts produced by your experiment.

- `--metrics` - set the path to the file or directory where the metrics produced
  by your experiment can be found (if any). Overrides other configuration and
  default value (`metrics.json`).

- `--plots` - set the path to the file or directory where the plots produced by
  your experiment can be found (if any). Overrides other configuration and
  default value (`plots/`).

- `--live` - set the path to the directory where the metrics and plots
  [produced by DVCLive](https://dvc.org/doc/dvclive/dvclive-with-dvc#outputs)
  will be found. Overrides the default values for `--metrics` and `--plots`.

- `--explicit` - do not assume default locations of project dependencies and
  outputs. You'll have to provide specific locations via other options or
  `dvc config exp`. In `--interactive` this removes default values from prompts.

- `-f`, `--force` - overwrite an existing stage in `dvc.yaml` file without
  asking for confirmation (same as `dvc stage add --force`).

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Example: interactive mode

Let's prepare an ML model training script to start running experiments on it.
The easiest route is using interactive mode and answering a few questions:

```dvc
$ dvc exp init --interactive
Command to execute: python src/train.py

Enter experiment dependencies.
Path to a code file/directory [src, n to omit]: src/train.py
Path to a data file/directory [data, n to omit]: data/features
Path to a parameters file [params.yaml, n to omit]:

Enter experiment outputs.
Path to a model file/directory [models, n to omit]: models/predict.h5
Path to a metrics file [metrics.json, n to omit]:
Path to a plots file/directory [plots, n to omit]: n

Creating dependencies: src/train.py and params.yaml
Creating output directories: models
Creating train stage in dvc.yaml

Ensure your experiment command creates metrics.json and models/predict.h5.
You can now run your experiment using "dvc exp run".
```

In this example the code, data, and model locations were specified above to
avoid using the defaults (which are too broad). `params.yaml` and `metrics.json`
are accepted (pressed Enter) for <abbr>parameters</abbr> and
<abbr>metrics</abbr>. Plots are omitted (entered `n`) as none will be written.

The resulting `dvc.yaml` file codifies the meta-information you provided in
DVC's format:

```yaml
train:
  cmd: python src/train.py
  deps:
    - data/features
    - src/train.py
  params:
    - params.yaml:
  outs:
    - models/predict.h5
  metrics:
    - metrics.json:
        cache: false
```

> Notes:
>
> - `train` is the default stage name unless you provide one with the `--name`
>   option.
> - The `epochs` param was obtained from the `params.yaml` file. Any other param
>   keys found there would all be listed under `params:` automatically.

The next step would be to tune `params.yaml` or improve `src/train.py` directly,
and start [running experiments](/doc/command-reference/exp/run).
