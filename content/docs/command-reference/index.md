<admon type="tip">

**New!** DVC is also available [for the VS Code IDE], which adds many DVC
operations [to the Command Palette].

The core of DVC is a command line tool. These pages contain the specifications,
self-contained descriptions, and comprehensive usage examples for `dvc`
commands. Use `dvc -h` to list them.

<admon type="tip">

To run DVC in a specific directory, use `dvc --cd <path> ...` before the command
and its options/arguments (does not change directories in your terminal).

## Typical DVC workflow

- Initialize a <abbr>DVC project</abbr> in a Git repo with `dvc init`.
- Copy data files or dataset directories for modeling into the project and use
  `dvc add` to tell DVC to <abbr>cache</abbr> and track them.
- Create a simple `dvc.yaml` file to codify a data processing
  [pipeline](/command-reference/dag). It uses your own source code and specifies
  further data <abbr>outputs</abbr> for DVC to control.
- Execute or restore any version of your pipeline using `dvc repro`, or
  experiment on it with `dvc exp` features.
- Sharing the <abbr>repository</abbr> will not include locally cached data. Use
  [remote storage] with `dvc push` and `dvc pull` to share data artifacts.
