# Using DVC Commands

DVC is a command line tool. The typical DVC workflow goes as follows:

- In an existing Git repository, initialize a <abbr>DVC project</abbr> with
  `dvc init`.
- Copy source code files for modeling into the repository and track the files
  with DVC using the `dvc add` command.
- Process raw data with your own data processing and modeling code, using the
  `dvc run` command, along with its `--outs` option for outputs that should also
  be tracked by DVC after the code is executed.
- Sharing a Git repository with the source code of your ML
  [pipeline](/doc/command-reference/pipeline) will not include the project's
  <abbr>cache</abbr>. Use [remote storage](/doc/command-reference/remote) and
  `dvc push` to share this cache (data tracked by DVC).
- Use `dvc repro` to automatically reproduce your full pipeline, iteratively as
  input data or source code change.

The command references under this section provide a precise specification,
complete description, and isolated usage examples for the `dvc` CLI tool. These
are our most technical documentation pages, similar to
[man-pages](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/) in Linux.
