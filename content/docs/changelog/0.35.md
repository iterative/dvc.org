# v0.19 - v0.35

We've launched the
[DVC Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/DVCorg/overview). It's one of the
ways to support the project if you like it.

Now, let's **highlight the changes** (not including bug fixes, and minor
improvements) we have done in the last few months:

- 🏷 We received a lot of feedback that using Git branches is not always an
  optimal way to manage experiments. We have added an option to **use all Git
  tags** (Git commits are coming), `-T` or `--all-tags`, which is supported by
  all DVC commands that also have `-a` or `--all-branches` (use all Git
  branches).

- 📖 The [Get Started](/doc/tutorials/get-started/agenda) tutorial has been
  simplified (e.g. to use tags instead of branches) and extended. We have also
  prepared a
  [DVC project on GitHub](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started) that
  reflects the sequence of chapters in the Get Started. You can now download the
  whole project and reproduce all the models.

- **`dvc diff`** **command introduced**. Summary statistics for the
  directory/file tracked by DVC. How many files were
  added/deleted/modified/size:

  ```diff
  (HEAD)$ tree image     (HEAD^)$ tree image
  images                 images
  ├── color.png          └── grey.png
  └── grey.png
  ```

  ```dvc
  $ dvc diff -t images HEAD^1

  diff for 'images'
  -images with md5 ad0a6adcd409cae3263b28487064e1f2.dir
  +images with md5 283215dface0d41291482330324632fc.dir

  1 file not changed, 0 files modified, 1 file added, 0 files deleted, size was increased by 15.3 MB
  ```

- We've introduced the `dvc commit` command and the
  `dvc run/repro/add --no-commit` option to give a way to **avoid uncontrolled
  cache growth** and as a way to save some runs of `dvc repro`. In the future we
  plan to have“do-not-cache-my-data”as a default mode for `dvc run`, `dvc add`
  and `dvc repro`.

- **SSH remotes (data storage) support** - config options to set port, key
  files, timeouts, password, etc + improved stability and Windows support!
  Introduced **HTTP remotes** - external dependencies and as a read-only cache.

- **Control over where DVC-files are located in your project** - place them
  wherever you want with the `-f` option supported by all relevant commands -
  `dvc add`, `dvc run`, and `dvc import`.

- 🙂 A lot of **UI improvements** . Starting from the finally fixed nasty issue
  with Windows command prompt printing a lot of garbage symbols, to using
  progress bars for checkouts, better CLI output for `dvc metrics`, and lots of
  smaller things: ![|528x200](/img/0.35-metrics.gif)

- ⚡️ **Performance optimizations.** The most notable one is the migration from
  using a plain JSON file to an (embedded) SQLLite instance, to cache file and
  directory hashes. Another one is improved performance, stability and general
  user experience for the commands that navigate tags or branches (all the
  commands that include `--all-bracnhes`, `-a` or `--all-tags`, `-T`).

There are new [integrations and plugins](/doc/install/plugins) available:

- Finally there is official [Bash and Zsh completion](/doc/install/completion)
  for DVC!
- David Příhoda contributed and is developing the
  [JetBrains IDEs plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11368-data-version-control-dvc-support)
  (PyCharm, IntelliJ, etc).

haven't yet. We are waiting for your feedback!
