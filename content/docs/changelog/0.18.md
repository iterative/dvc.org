# v0.12 - v0.18

We have been working hard last few weeks improving **user experience**,
**performance**, and **documentation**. Kudos to `@sotte` and `@Hong-Xiang` for
the great feedback they gave us!

We are very close to the 1.0 release! Two major changes are coming in DVC 1.0:
[commit semantics](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/919#issuecomment-414540094)
and
[execution matrix](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/973#issuecomment-412739728).
Both changes should make DVC more flexible for ML practitioners. Please, read,
discuss and let us know about your thoughts!

Since the last announcement we have released versions 0.12 through 0.18 and are
really excited to share the progress with you:

- ‚ö° **DVC just got faster**

  - Data files management commands like `dvc add`, `dvc push`, `dvc pull`, etc.
    got up to 10x faster on datasets with large number of files.

  - Commands startup latency reduced 3x

- üìô **Documentation got better** - a whole new [Get Started](/doc/get-started)
  section, new [Use Cases](/doc/use-cases), [User Guide](/doc/user-guide), and
  lot of other great stuff you can find here.

- üôÇ **Usability improvements** - DVC interface got more informative and easier
  to use:

  - More heavy operations render dynamic progress bar (e.g. file hash
    computation): ![](/img/0.18-progress.gif)

  - Pipeline visualization via command line. Just run `dvc pipeline show` with
    option `--ascii` and a target: ![](/img/0.18-pipeline.gif)

  - Many hidden gems: `dvc repro` dry and interactive modes, improved overall
    commands verbosity and revised commands help.

- üíé **Other changes include** - [DEB and RPM repositories](/doc/install), bug
  fixes and other things you can check in the complete
  [changelog](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/releases).
