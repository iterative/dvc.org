# On the war in Ukraine üá∫üá¶

While the war in Ukraine has impacted the world, it has also greatly impacted
our company as we have team members living in Ukraine and Russia, and many with
family ties to both. Our hearts are with our Iterative family in Ukraine and we
are committed to doing everything we can to support the safety of our Ukrainian,
as well as the transition of our Russian colleagues during this crisis.

We as a company are against this war. We have donated to the humanitarian
efforts to help the people of Ukraine and are matching our team members'
donations as well. We are proud of the perseverance, care, and support coming
from our team at this time.

If you are able, we ask that you consider these resources as ways to help. Our
hope is that the world will find a quick and peaceful end to this war and
Ukraine will be restored, even stronger than before. üá∫üá¶

## Mihail Eric: MLOps is a Mess But That's to be Expected

[**Mihail Eric**](https://twitter.com/mihail_eric) writes a long, but _really
worth it_ piece entitled
[MLOps is a Mess But That‚Äôs to be Expected.](https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/mlops-is-a-mess/)
In it he discusses the allure of seeking a machine learning career, only run
smack into the giant wall of learning that encompasses the space, not the least
of which is the multitude of tools to pick through once you get there. The state
of machine learning is reviewed and some history of DevOps for perspective on
MLOps is added.  
You will find advice for newcomers and some final, thorough, thoughts and
predictions especially as they relate to ‚ÄúML at a reasonable scale‚Äù companies.  
Definitely worth your review!

## Kevin Lu: Learn how to use Data Version Control to remove the third wheel from your relationship

![Learn how to use Data Version Control to remove the third wheel from your relationship](/uploads/images/2022-03-17/kevin.png 'Learn how to use Data Version Control to remove the third wheel from your relationships :wrap-right ==300')
In
[this hilarious post,](https://medium.com/@kevinylu/learn-how-to-use-data-version-control-to-remove-the-third-wheel-from-your-relationship-ce4c2afa649c)
[**Kevin Lu**](https://medium.com/@kevinylu) teaches us how to use DVC to enable
us to disconnect from our unhealthy addictive relationships with our computers
and make room for more human relationships! You don't want to miss the humor,
productivity and wisdom here, all while helping you understand how each of DVC's
commands help your machine learning engineering exploits.

## Thanakorn Panyapiang: Putting A Machine Learning model into production with Google Cloud Platform and DVC

Are you a data scientist new to putting models into production?  
[In this piece](https://towardsdatascience.com/putting-machine-learning-model-into-production-with-google-cloud-platform-and-dvc-f6a22cdcf4a5)
[**Thanakorn Panyapiang**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpanyapiang/) describes
various model deployment strategies to put projects into production including
model-as-service, batch prediction and model-on-edge. In his example he uses a
batch prediction approach with an image segmentation model to identify clouds.
He uses DVC as a model registry with Google Cloud storage and GitHub actions to
automate the Cloud Functions deployment. See all the steps he outlines in his
piece to get real value out of your machine learning projects.

## Matthew Upson: MLOps for Conversational AI with Rasa, DVC, and CML (PartII)

In the [December Heartbeat,](https://dvc.org/blog/december-21-heartbeat) I told
you about [**Matt Upson's**](https://twitter.com/m_a_upson) first post in his
series on using DVC, CML and Rasa together.
[In this second post](https://medium.com/mantisnlp/mlops-for-conversational-ai-with-rasa-dvc-and-cml-part-ii-3a70fe2f357d)
he goes through some Rasa basics and gets the DVC pipeline setup, with its train
and test stages, params, dependencies, outs and metrics. He also covers syncing
with DVC, making changes, the `dvc repro` command, the `.dvc-lock` file, and
pushing to remote storage. We're looking forward to the next installment when we
will see how CML can be used to automatically train the model.

## Sibanjan Das: MLOps for Enterprise AI

[**Sibanjan Das**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sibanjan/) notes the trending of
the MLOps keyword in
[his piece](https://dzone.com/articles/mlops-for-enterprise-ai) in
[DZone.](https://dzone.com) Sibanjan gives an overview of MLOps and how it
supports the AI/ML ecosystem to deliver return on investment for ML projects. He
reviews the components of MLOps, including automated ML model building
pipelines, model serving, model version control, model/data monitoring, and
security and governance. He also discusses the MLOps maturity models of Google
and Microsoft (see below). I found this part especially interesting as it
mirrors what we see in our Community and how they develop using our tools as
well. Finally, he outlines some tools that help in the process, including DVC.

## Jagreet Kaur: Implementing DevOps for Machine Learning - A Quick Guide

![Tensorflow, PyTorch, DVC, Docker, CI/CD](/uploads/images/2022-03-17/jagreet-kaur.png 'Continuous Development Life Cycle Guide from Xenostack :wrap-left ==300')
[**Jagreet Kaur**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagreetkaur/) of
[Xenonstack](https://www.xenonstack.com/) authors
[a guide](https://www.xenonstack.com/blog/devops-for-machine-learning) on
applying DevOps to machine learning and generally what the continuous
development life cycle is as it relates to machine learning projects. Jagreet
goes over all the fun continuous topics including, continuous integration,
continuous testing, continuous retraining, and continuous deployment. She gives
an overview of the use of Tensor Flow, PyTorch, and Docker, as well as DVC for
version control, experiment management deployment, and collaboration. Additional
resources from Xenonstack are provided for further review.

### Yuqi Li: Why MLOps should be Open Source

![Why MLOps Tools should be Open Source](/uploads/images/2022-03-17/yuqi-li.jpeg 'Why MLOps Tools should be Open Source :wrap-right ==300')
[**Yuqi Li**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuqiliofficial/)
[in this opinion piece,](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-mlops-tools-should-be-open-source-5ad696463f54)
in [Towards Data Science.](https://towardsdatascience.com/) overviews the
meaning and components of MLOps and identifies a number of good open-source
tools in the space which of course includes DVC. He also outlines a number of
reasons why MLOps should be open source. Among the reasons making the cut:

1. Cost-Effectiveness
2. Ownership
3. No privacy concern
4. Build Community around the tool Examine these reasons to determine if open
   source makes sense for your MLOps work. We think you will.

## And speaking of Community‚Ä¶

## Mert Bozkir: Community-Driven Learning

If you‚Äôve been in our Discord server, been to one of our Meetups, or interacted
with us on Twitter, you‚Äôve surely come across DVC Community All-Star
[**Mert Bozkir**](https://github.com/mertbozkir). Mert has written
[a great piece](https://medium.com/@mertbozkir/community-driven-learning-2481103aa190)
Entitled _Community Driven Learning_ and describes how it is the best way to
learn. He outlines his reasoning for this including the support, encouragement,
and motivation you can get from the Community to be persistent in your learning
efforts. He also includes eight communities that are great for learning, with
invites included. Be sure to check it out!
