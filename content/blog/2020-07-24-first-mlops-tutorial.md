Earlier this month, we launched [CML](https://cml.dev), our latest open-source
project in the MLOps space. We think it's a step towards establishing powerful
DevOps practices (like continuous integration) as a regular fixture of machine
learning and data science projects. But there are plenty of challenges ahead,
and a big one is _literacy_.

So many data scientists, like developers, are self-taught. Data science degrees
have only recently emerged on the scene, which means if you polled a handful of
senior-level data scientists, there'd almost certainly be no universal training
or certificate among them. Moreover, there's still no widespread agreement about
what it takes to be a data scientist: is it an engineering role with a little
bit of Tensorflow sprinkled on top? A title for statisticians who can code?
We're not expecting an easy resolution to these existential questions anytime
soon.

In the meantime, we're starting a video series to help data scientists curious
about DevOps (and developers and engineeers curious about data science!) get
started. Through hands-on coding examples and use cases, we want to give data
science practitioners the fundamentals to explore, use, and influence MLOps.

The first video in this series uses a lightweight and fairly popular data
science problem- building a model to predict wine quality ratings- as a
playground to introduce continuous integration.

The tutorial covers:

- Using Git-flow in a data science project (making a feature branch and pull
  request)
- Creating your first GitHub Action to train and evaluate a model
- Using CML to generate visual reports in your pull request summarizing model
  performance

It's now up on YouTube!

[Code for the project is available online](https://github.com/andronovhopf/wine)
so you can follow along! We also recommend checking out the
[CML docs](https://github.com/iterative/cml) for more details, tutorials, and
use cases.

If you have questions, the best way to get in touch is by leaving a comment on
the blog, video, or our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/bzA6uY7). And,
we're especially interested to hear what use cases you'd like to see covered in
future videos- tell us about your data science project and how you could imagine
using continuous integration, and we might be able to create a video!
