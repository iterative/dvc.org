In data science, we frequently deal with classification problems like, _is this
[Yelp reviewer unhappy](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~vpsaini/) with their brunch? Is
[this email](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase) begging me to
claim my long-lost inheritance spam? Does this
[movie critic](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) have a positive
opinion of Cats?_

Perhaps we should also consider the fundamental introspective matter of, _am I
maybe being a bit of an asshole?_

I want to share a dataset of collected moral dilemmas shared on Reddit, as well
as the judgments handed down by a jury of Redditors. The wellspring of this data
is the [r/AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/) subreddit, one
of the natural wonders of the digital world. In this article, I'll show you
what's in the dataset, how to get it, and some things you can do to move the
frontiers of Asshole research forward.

## What makes an Asshole?

r/AmItheAsshole is a semi-structured online forum that’s the internet’s closest
approximation of a judicial system. In this corner of the web, citizens post
situations from their lives and Redditors vote to decide if the writer has acted
as The Asshole or not. For example:

Without bringing any code into the picture, it’s intuitive to think of each new
post as a classification task for the subreddit. Formally, we could think of the
subreddit as executing a function _f_ such that

![](/uploads/images/2020-02-17/aita_formula.png '=500')

Of course, finding f won’t be trivial. To be frank, I’m not positive how well we
could hope to forecast the rulings of the subreddit. A lot of posts are not easy
for me to decide- like,

There are also many times I find myself disagreeing with the subreddit’s
verdict. All this is to say, I don’t think it’s obvious how well a given human
would do on the task of predicting whether Redditors find someone an Asshole.
Nor is it clear how well we could ever hope for a machine to do approximating
their judgment.

It seems fun to try, though. It helps that the data is plentiful: because the
subreddit is popular and well-moderated, there’s an especially strong volume of
high-quality content (re: on-topic and appropriately formatted) being posted
daily.

## Building the dataset

I pulled content from r/AmITheAsshole dating from the first post in 2012 to
January 1, 2020 using the [pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/) API to get post
ids and
[scores](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_how_is_a_submission.27s_score_determined.3F),
followed by Reddit’s API ([praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to get
post content and meta-data. Using a
[similar standard as OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/)
for trawling Reddit, I collected text from posts with scores of 3 or more only
for quality control. This cut the number of posts from ~355K to ~111K. Each data
point contains an official id code, timestamp, post title, post text, verdict,
score, and comment count; usernames are not included. The scraping and cleaning
code is available
[in the project GitHub repo](https://github.com/iterative/aita_dataset). For
simplicity on the first iteration of this problem, I didn’t scrape post
comments, which can number in the thousands for popular posts. But, should
sufficient interest arise, I’d consider adding them to the dataset in some form.

To focus on the task of classifying posts, I did some light cleaning: I removed
posts in which the body of the text was redacted (surprisingly common) or blank,
and attempted to remove edits where the author had clearly given away the
verdict (e.g., an edit that says, “Update: You’re right, I was the asshole.”).
There were also verdicts that only occurred once (“cheap asshole”, “Crouching
Liar; hidden asshole”, “the pizza is the asshole”), so I restricted the dataset
to posts with standard verdicts. This left ~63K points. Below is a sample of the
resulting dataframe:

![](/uploads/images/2020-02-17/df_sample.png)_Click to enlarge._

The dataset is a snapshot of the subreddit in its current state, but the
subreddit is certain to change over time as new content gets added. In the
interest of having the most comprehensive dataset about being an asshole ever
collected, _I’m planning to update this dataset monthly with new posts._

## How to get the dataset

Since this dataset will be updated regularly, we’re using git and DVC to
package, version, and release it. The data itself is stored in an S3 bucket, and
you can use DVC to import the data to your workspace. If you haven't already
you'll need to [install DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/install); one of the simplest
ways is `pip install dvc`.

Say you have a directory on your local machine where you plan to build some
analysis scripts. Simply run

```dvc
$ dvc get https://github.com/iterative/aita_dataset \
      aita_clean.csv
```

This will download a .csv dataset into your local directory, corresponding to
the cleaned version. If you wanted the raw dataset, you would substitute
`aita_raw.csv` for `aita_clean.csv`.

Because the dataset is >100 MB, I’ve created a git branch (called “lightweight”)
with 10,000 randomly sampled (cleaned) data points for quick-and-dirty
experimentation that won’t occupy all your laptop’s memory. To download only
this smaller dataset, run

```dvc
$ dvc get --rev lightweight \
      https://github.com/iterative/aita_dataset \
      aita_clean.csv
```

## A quick look at the data

Let’s take a flyover look at the dataset so far. The code to make the following
visuals and results is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/andronovhopf/aita_viz_and_classify).
First, here’s a frequency plot for how common different verdicts are on the
subreddit. In addition to “Asshole” and “Not the Asshole”, there are two
additional rulings: “Everybody Sucks” and “No Assholes Here”.

![](/uploads/images/2020-02-17/freq_plot.svg)

In general agreement with an
[analysis by Nathan Cunn](http://www.nathancunn.com/2019-04-04-am-i-the-asshole/),
the majority of posts are deemed “Not the Asshole” or “No Assholes Here”. If you
are posting on r/AmITheAsshole, you are probably not the asshole.

Next, I attempted a very basic classifier, logistic regression using 1-gram
frequencies (i.e., the frequency of word occurences in post titles and bodies)
as features. This is intended to give a baseline for what kind of performance
any future modeling efforts should beat. Because of the strong class imbalance,
I used
[SMOTE to oversample](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/over_sampling.html#smote-variants)
Asshole posts. And, for simplicity, I binarized the category labels:

|     Verdict      | Label |
| :--------------: | :---: |
|     Asshole      |   1   |
|  Everyone Sucks  |   1   |
| Not the Asshole  |   0   |
| No Assholes Here |   0   |

With 5-fold cross-validation, this classifier performed above-chance but
modestly: accuracy was 62.0% +/- 0.005 (95% confidence interval). Curiously, the
only other classifier attempt I could find online
[reported 61% accuracy on held-out data](https://github.com/amr-amr/am-i-the-asshole)
using the much more powerful BERT architecture. Considering that logistic
regression has zero hidden layers, and our features discard sequential
information entirely, we’re doing quite well! Although I can’t be certain, I’m
curious how much the discrepancy comes down to dataset size: the previous effort
with BERT appears to be trained on ~30K posts.

Seeing that logistic regression on word counts doesn’t produce total garbage, I
looked at which words were predictive of class using the
[chi-squared test](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.chi2.html).
The top five informative words were mom, wife, mother, edit, and dad (looks like
Assholes go back to edit their posts). Since familial relationships featured
prominently, I
[estimated the log odds ratio](https://www.tidytextmining.com/twitter.html#comparing-word-usage)
of being voted Asshole (versus Not the Asshole) if your post mentions a mom,
dad, girlfriend/wife or boyfriend/husband. Roughly, the log odds ratio
represents the difference in probability of a keyword occurring in Asshole posts
compared to Not-Asshole posts.

![](/uploads/images/2020-02-17/svg_kw2.svg)

For reference, the log odd ratios are computed with base 2; a score of 1 means
that Asshole posts are twice as likely to contain the keyword as Not the Asshole
posts. So keep in mind that the effect sizes we’re detecting, although almost
certainly non-zero, are still fairly small.

There seems to be a slight anti-parent trend, with Redditors being more likely
to absolve authors who mention a mom or dad. Only mentioning a female romantic
partner (wife/girlfriend) was associated with a greater likelihood of being
voted the Asshole. This surprised me. My unsubstantiated guess about the gender
difference in mentioning romantic partners is that women may be particularly
likely to question themselves when they act assertively in a relationship. If
this were the case, we might find an especially high proportion of
uncontroversial “Not the Asshole” posts from heterosexual women asking about
situations with their male partners.

## How to get more data

As I said earlier, the plan is to grow the dataset over time. I’ve just run a
new scrape for posts from January 1-31, 2020 and am adding them to the public
dataset now. To check for a new release, you can re-run the `dvc get` command
you used to grab the dataset.

If you’re serious about taking on a project such as, say, building a classifier
that beats our state of the art, word-count-based, logistic regression model,
I’d like to recommend a better way to integrate the dataset into your workflow:
`dvc import`. `dvc import` is like `dvc get`, but it preserves a link to the
hosted data set. This is desirable if you might iterate through several
experiments in the search for the right architecture, for example, or think
you’ll want to re-train a model . To get the dataset the first time, you’ll run:

```dvc
$ git init
$ dvc init
$ dvc import https://github.com/iterative/aita_dataset \
      aita_clean.csv
```

Then, because the dataset in your workspace is linked to our dataset repository,
you can update it by simply running:

```dvc
$ dvc update aita_clean.csv
```

An additional benefit of codifying the link between your copy of the dataset and
ours is that you can track the form of the dataset you used at different points
in your project development. You can jump back and forth through the project
history then, not only to previous versions of code but also to versions of
(specifically, links to) data. For example, you could roll back the state of the
project to before you updated the dataset and re-run your classifier:

```dvc
$ git log --oneline
58e28a5 retrain logistic reg
6a44161 update aita dataset
0de4fc3 try logistic regression classifier
a266f15 get aita dataset
55031b0 first commit

$ git checkout 0de4fc3
$ dvc checkout
$ python train_classifier.py
```

Oh, and one more note: you can always use `dvc get` and `dvc import` to grab an
older version of the dataset using the tags associated with each release. The
current release is v.20.1 and the original release is v.20.0- the numeric codes
correspond to the year and month.

```dvc
$ dvc get --rev v.20.0 \
      https://github.com/iterative/aita_dataset aita_clean.csv
```

## What’s next

I hope that sharing this evolving dataset invites some curiosity, because a lot
of questions come to mind:

1. Can you beat our classifier that predicts how the subreddit will rule?
2. Is verdict even the most interesting outcome to predict? For example,
   developer Scott Ratigan
   [created a tool to estimate weighted scores](https://github.com/scotteratigan/amitheahole)
   for each post based on the comments (e.g., 75% Asshole, 25% Not the Asshole).
   What metrics might invite deeper questions?
3. Can you identify sentences or phrases that are most informative about the
   verdict Redditors reach?
4. Do voting patterns systematically differ by topic of discussion?
5. How reliable are verdicts? When a very similar situation is posted multiple
   times, do Redditors usually vote the same way?
6. Is the subreddit’s posting and voting behavior changing over time?
7. Can you formulate any testable hypotheses based on
   [this survey of the subreddit’s demographics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dcae07/2019_subscriber_survey_data_dump/?)
8. How often do non-Redditors agree with the subreddit? Under what circumstances
   might they tend to disagree?

I expect that leaning into the particulars of the dataset- thinking about how
the format influences the content, and how a subreddit might select for
participants that don’t fully represent the population at large- will lead to
more interesting questions than, say, aiming to forecast something about
morality in general. To put it another way, the data’s not unbiased- so maybe
try to learn something about those biases.

If you make something with this dataset, please share- perhaps we can form an
international Asshole research collective, or at least keep each other appraised
of findings. And of course, reach out if you encounter any difficulties or
probable errors (you can file issues
[on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/iterative/aita_dataset))!

Lastly, please stay tuned for more releases- there are hundreds of new posts
every day. The biggest asshole may still be out there.

[pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/), a database that contains basically all of
Reddit's content (so why make this dataset? I wanted to remove some of the
barriers to analyzing text from r/AmItheAsshole by providing an
already-processed and cleaned version of the data that can be downloaded with a
line of code; pushshift takes some work). You might use pushshift's API and/or
praw to augment this dataset in some way- perhaps to compare activity in this
subreddit with another, or broader patterns on Reddit.
