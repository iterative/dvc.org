## Vanishing Gradients Podcast

![Vanishing Gradients](/uploads/images/2022-08-16/vanishing-gradients.png 'Vanishing Gradients :wrap-left =300')
If you are not familiar with
[**Hugo Bowne-Anderson**](https://twitter.com/hugobowne), you should be. He was
the host of my all-time favorite Data Science podcast
[DataFramed](https://www.datacamp.com/podcast) while he was at
[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). DataFramed helped me immeasurably when I
started my data science journey. It provided great not only great teachings on
many data science concepts, but even more importantly, the ability to gain
perspectives from different people across all parts of the data space, talking
about challenges, danger zones, and issues that we all need to be aware of in
the field. Recently Hugo started a new podcast,
[Vanishing Gradients](https://vanishinggradients.fireside.fm/). This newer
endeavor is in a somewhat different format than DataFramed, but still with
Hugo's characteristic deep dive into all the challenges that come up when
working with data. Hugo uses a long-format conversation approach with many
leaders and great thinkers in the data science/machine learning/AI space. In
episodes [seven](https://vanishinggradients.fireside.fm/7) and
[eight,](https://vanishinggradients.fireside.fm/8) Hugo has a fascinating chat
with [**Peter Wang**](https://twitter.com/pwang), CEO of Anaconda, in which they
talk about a number of topics including how Python became so big in Data
Science, the emergence of open source collaborative environments, and things
that the PyData stack solves. Then it gets really interesting as they dive into
the open source model in the context of finite and infinite games and open
source software as a "paradigm of humanity's ability to create generative,
nourishing and anti-rivalrous systems." ü§Ø Super interesting discussion and food
for thought. I've already listened to both episodes twice. I highly recommend
them and this new podcast in general.

# From the Iterative tools Community

## **Miko≈Çaj Kania** - Can DVC Be Used for Kaggle?

[**Miko≈Çaj Kania**](https://twitter.com/MikolajKania) suggests that you upgrade
your Kaggle competition workflow from the ‚Äúspaghetti code‚Äù of Jupyter Notebooks
and use the more mature way of creating reproducible ML results by using DVC
[here on his blog](https://mikolajkania.com/2022/08/07/dvc-kaggle-mlops/).

He notes that notebooks are really bad to compare changes between runs. Instead,
he suggests developing a workflow where for every major experiment type,
creating a branch - experimenting in each and persisting the best and most
notable outcomes (good and bad). The best results are then submitted to Kaggle.
You can find more about his workflow in
[his repo for the project.](https://github.com/mikolajkania/kaggle-03-house-prices)

_DVC with Kaggle
([Source link](https://mikolajkania.com/2022/08/07/dvc-kaggle-mlops/))_

Miko≈Çaj explains how DVC's project structure ensures reproducible results and
develops habits on best practices. One drawback he noted was the lack of an
experimentation UI, but we just introduced the DVC extension for VS Code to help
with that, and there‚Äôs always Iterative Studio. Look out for improvement to the
experiment features in both tools in the coming months! Also, experimenting with
DVC in Kaggle may give you some good practice for things we are cooking up
internally! üòâü§´

## **Shambhavi Mishra** - Searching for Semantic Similarity

[**Shambhavi Mishra**](https://twitter.com/ShambhaviCodes) in her post
[Searching for Semantic Similarity](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/searching-for-semantic-similarity-cfbff2388d04)
details the steps of her NLP project on similarity algorithms. She mainly
focuses on cosine similarity using a Stack Overflow questions dataset. The
end-to-end project uses Sentence BERT, Fast Text, DVC, DAGsHub, Streamlit and
deploys the web app on an AWS EC2 instance.

Once you follow all the steps you will have computed the similarity between a
search query and a database of texts and rank all the data by their similarity
score to retrieve the most similar text to its index.

## **Evgenii Munin** - Run S3 Locally With MinIO for the DVC Machine Learning Pipeline

If you are in need of object storage to work with data through an API, but need
to do so in a private network,
[**Evgenii Munin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgenii-munin-01932a143/) shows
how to set up MinIO as remote storage with DVC to do just that
[in this piece in Medium](https://betterprogramming.pub/run-s3-locally-with-minio-for-dvc-machine-learning-pipeline-7fa3d240d3ab).
In this cool use case, he starts with installing the MinIO server and builds a
Docker image to run it, sharing a great repo on Kafka-to S3 where MinIO was used
to mock the S3 for the data. Then he shows you how to link the MinIO server as
DVC remote storage.

## **Caleb Kaiser** - Moving from Data Science to Machine Learning Engineering

It can sometimes be confusing to determine where data science stops and machine
learning engineering starts. [**Caleb Kaiser**](https://twitter.com/KaiserFrose)
helps clarify this
[in this old but good piece](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/11/moving-data-science-machine-learning-engineering.html)
in [KD Nuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com). He provides four examples of real-
world projects and defines what portions of the project are data science and
what are ML engineering. In all what we find is that machine learning
engineering is all the tasks that need to happen to get the model the data
scientists create into production applications.

He goes on to dive deeper into one of the examples and shows the promise in some
tools that bridge the gap between machine learning and software engineering
where he highlights DVC and Huggingface. This is a good piece to read if you are
grappling with the difference!

## Just a few other things...

- GitHub Goodness alert for
  [Visual Data Preparation (VDP),](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp) an
  open-source visual data ETL tool to streamline the end-to-end visual data
  processing pipeline. Among the highlights: a fast way to build end-to-end
  visual data pipelines, pre-built ETL data connectors, and integration with DVC
- [**Jillian Rowe**](https://twitter.com/jillianerowe) gave a shout-out to DVC
  on a
  [recent podcast](https://topenddevs.com/podcasts/adventures-in-devops/episodes/the-intersection-of-data-and-devops-devops-124)
  from

### üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Iterative's First Internal Hackathon

Last week we had our very first internal Hackathon! The entire company
participated in the 48-hour computer vision challenge classifying dogs, cats,
croissants and muffins. Part of the objective was to familiarize ourselves and
test a new tool that we are expecting to release later this year.

Eight teams competed for prizes for the best outcome, but also for the best
integrations with other tools, the best dog, cat, croissant, and muffin photos
from team members, and the best notes from the experience. I think the notes of
our newest DevRel [**Gema Parre√±o Piqueras**](https://twitter.com/SoyGema) are
in good running for the prize. (Learn more about Gema in the New Hires section
below!)
