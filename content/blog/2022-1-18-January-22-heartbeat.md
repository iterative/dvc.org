## Diego Jardim - MLOps: A Complete Hands-On Introduction

[In Part 1](https://poatek.com/2021/12/20/mlops-a-complete-and-hands-on-introduction-part-1/)
of his two-part series,
[**Diego Jardim**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegosevero/) of
[Poatek](https://poatek.com/) takes us through the basics of MLOps and the
stages of implementation and maturity of an MLOps pipeline. He closes by
introducing us to some tools to help a team progress through these stages, which
include DVC and CML.

[In Part 2](https://poatek.com/2021/12/29/mlops-a-complete-and-hands-on-introduction-part-2/)
he delves into more detail and code on how to set up version control of
everything with DVC as well as automation of experimentation and reporting with
CML. Finally, he uses FastAPI and Heroku for model serving and deployment. You
can find all the scripts for the project in
[this GitHub repository.](https://github.com/dsjardim/fraud-detection-mlops)

## Carl W. Handlin Wallace - Reproducible Data Science and Why it Matters

[**Carl W. Handlin Wallace**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlhandlin/) of
[RappiBank](https://www.rappibank.pe/) wrote a
[great article](https://medium.com/rappibank/reproducible-data-science-and-why-it-matters-e4e62fd60b9a/)
for their company [Medium](https://medium.com/) profile on the importance of
reproducibility, AKA replicability, in science in general, and the challenges in
Data Science in particular. As he points out, from
[Nature's survey,](https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a) over half of all researchers
have failed to reproduce even their own work, let alone that of another
scientist. While initiatives like
[Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) are helping to encourage
reproducibility in the industry, there's still work to be done. He notes DVC as
a part of the solution to this problem along with other tools to round out the
whole picture. Check out the article for good food for thought and other
resources!

## Abid Ali Awan - Tips & Tricks of Deploying Deep Learning Webapp on Heroku Cloud

![DVC Heroku Integration](/uploads/images/2022-01-18/abid-ali-awan.png 'Heroku Hidden Tricks :wrap-right ==450')

[**Abid Ali Awan**'s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/1abidaliawan/)
[article in KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/12/tips-tricks-deploying-dl-webapps-heroku.html)  
guides you on how to create a smooth process to deploy a deep learning web
application with Heroku. In the guide, he covers integration with DVC and
optimizing storage using Docker, Git & CLI-based deployment, how to deal with
error code H10, and tweaking Python packages to stay within the 500 MB Heroku
limitation. If you've been looking for a way to create a deep learning web app,
this may help!

## Amit Kulkarni - Overview of MLOps with Open Source Tools

In the very
[**FIRST** tutorial of DVC Studio](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/01/overview-of-mlops-with-open-source-tools/)
from the Community,
[**Amit Kulkarni**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/amitvkulkarni2) reviews the set
up process of DVC Studio and MLFlow and their ability to ease the operational
aspects of machine learning teams by providing a clear way to solve the
formidable task of tracking all the factors that go into the iterative process.
Amit covers the easy setup process, adding a view, model comparison, and running
experiments from the DVC Studio UI.

[Last month](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohjUZZEFfWJfaeKUE/giphy.gif) I told
you about Thoughtworks' guide to MLOps Platforms. If you prefer video content,
you may like

framework for deciding on your tools in his presentation at
[DevOpsDays Tel Aviv](https://devopsdays.org/events/2021-tel-aviv/welcome/). In
this talk you will learn guidelines and mental models that will help you choose
tools in whatever stage of the process you are in.

## In Other Data Science and AI News

### Rob Toews AI Predictions in Forbes

[**Rob Toews**](https://www.twitter.com/_RobToews) wrote
[10 AI Predictions for 2022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2021/12/22/10-ai-predictions-for-2022/?sh=559c4c8d482d)
for [Forbes.](https://forbes.com) In it he predicts more startups getting funded
in NLP than any other category, reinforcement learning to become increasingly
important, the rise of synthetic data, and powerful new AI tools being built for
video. My favorite prediction:

> Responsible AI' will begin to shift from a vague catch-all term to an
> operationalized set of enterprise practices."  
> That's good news!

### Chip Huyen's Latest Blog Post

You may remember [**Chip Huyen**](https://twitter.com/chipro) from
[MLOps Tooling Landscape v2](https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/30/mlops-v2.html) and
[DVC's inclusion in her Machine Learning Systems Design Lecture series](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15ZrLFzimfy-8ob7mJ0qHPNyVoTtSfKBF5gPPG5f0Lz8/edit#slide=id.p).
But at the turn of the new year, she published a new blog post entitled
[Real-time machine learning: Challenges and Solutions.](https://huyenchip.com/2022/01/02/real-time-machine-learning-challenges-and-solutions.html)
The article describes her learning from working with approximately 30 companies
in different industries doing real-time machine learning. She describes the
online prediction processes of batch prediction and streaming prediction.

Additionally she discusses continual learning and the difference between
stateless retraining (the model is trained from scratch each time), and stateful
training (the model continues training on new data) and moving from a manual
process to a more automated one. Definitely worth a read and we believe DVC and
CML can help you with your stateful training!

She and her team are running a [survey](https://forms.gle/dDvgF7QgpPdvJE5b8) to
better understand the adoption and challenges of real-time ML. We enourage your
participation!

### Vicki Boykis' Top three Fundamental Tools for a Machine Learning Engineer

![Git, SQL, CLI](/uploads/images/2022-01-18/git-sql-cli.jpeg 'Git, SQL, CLI :wrap-left ==300')
If you're interested in becoming a machine learning engineer and you're not
familiar with [**Vicki Boykis**,](https://twitter.com/vboykis) you should be.
She has an amazing blog with years of well-written, funny, technical content on
machine learning. Her latest piece entitled
[Git, SQL, CLI](https://vickiboykis.com/2022/01/09/git-sql-cli/) tells why she
thinks these three tools are fundamental tools for any technical job. We think
so too.

# DVC News

## Our Online Course is Live! üéâ

You can register for the FREE new course
[here on the Iterative website](https://learn.iterative.ai). The course is
currently in beta mode. We already have some things we are working on to make it
even better, but we would love your feedback! üôèüèº So far we have had some minor
glitches and a lot of positive feedback! But we want your critiques too!

**Whoever can give us feedback on any three modules by February 6th will receive
some fresh new swag!**

We are already planning our next course!

## Experiment Versioning piece in KDNuggets

Our Senior Developer Advocate
[**Maria Khalusova**](https://twitter.com/mariaKhalusova) wrote a tutorial piece
on `exp init` and experiment versioning entitled
[Versioning Machine Learning Experiments vs Tracking Them.](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/12/versioning-machine-learning-experiments-tracking.html)
The command helps you quickly set up a pipeline and codify your experiments with
all of the factors that contributed to each of them, including data, code,
pipeline, model version and all hyperparameters. This is a step above other
experiment tracking tools and enables you to achieve true reproducibility.
