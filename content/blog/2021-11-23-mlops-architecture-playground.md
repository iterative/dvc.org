## Intro

As the Community Manager at Iterative, I am charged with taking care of and
serving our Community . I scour the internet ingesting all the amazing content
our users create, talk to you at Meetups, and have listened to your challenges
and pain points in calls with you or through Discord. Over this time, some
things I've noticed in the Community and life in general:

- The best (and most shared) content has good images and diagrams to drive
  clarity
- Given the flexibility and hands-off-your-code characteristics of our tools, it
  can sometimes be challenging for people to conceptualize their workflows
- diagram images can often be hard to read in a blog post because they take up a
  lot of space and are illegible when condensed
- the best solutions and ideas most often come from many places
- many hands make light work
- we have an awesome Community of exceptional humans!

So digesting these things and attending other community events where a Miro
board was used to collaborate and solve problems, I came up with the idea for
the **MLOps Architecture Playground** in Miro.

### What?

What this will be is a place for people in the greater MLOps Community to come
and work out their architecture issues. This could be a small piece of the
puzzle or the greater architecture of your entire workflow and tool stack.  
What we aim to provide you is a place to work it out and all the components you
need to create it fast (Or as fast as possible, given that this is complicated
stuff!). Your work in here will likely help other Community members struggling
with the same issues.

### Who is this board for?

Everyone! You don't just have to use Iterative tools to use this board. We know
that our tools are good building blocks in your MLOps tools stack, but there are
many other tools. And our tools integrate with many. Feel free to work out your
diagram even if it does not use our tools. We're all in this together!

### How will this work?

1. Use this link [needed from MailChimp, figuring out], to enter the MLOps
   Architecture Playground. It will take your email and you will receive access
   to the board. This is for security purposes only, to discourage trolls. It
   will not connect you to our Newsletter or anything else. I might send you an
   email about cool new diagrams that show up in the space from time to time or
   organizational issues as the board grows, but more than likely, these will be
   few and far between.
2. Stake your ground in Miro's infinite board.

3. Make a copy of the Label and fill out the items on it as they pertain to your
   diagram. Include your contact info (email, Discord, LinkedIn, Twitter).
   Whatever you are comfortable with. You never know when you will find a new
   friend somewhere around the world that is grappling with a similar thing and
   you can work it out together.
4. Make copies of the different components and start creating your diagram!
5. Checkout the Iterative tools request board - grab a request and get to work!
   Anyone that has completed one of the desired diagrams will get some swag! ðŸ¤©
   Email Jeny@iterative.ai when complete with a link to the diagram.
6. Other tool companies can put up a request board as well
7. If you already have a diagram created that you would like to share, you can
   copy the image over to the board. Be sure to add the label and put it in a
   frame. Frames enable a link to exactly that place with in the Miro board and
   help keep things organized.

### The Rules (Let's Play Nice, Shall We?)

ðŸ˜¬ I have no control over what you put into this board until after you do it. If
you are a bad actor, put something offensive or inappropriate, It will be
deleted. So don't bother. Don't ruin a helpful tool for everyone else. We all
have too much good work to do to waste time being jerks. Thanks! - The
Management

## Conclusion

Ba-dat-bum. Need to finish.
