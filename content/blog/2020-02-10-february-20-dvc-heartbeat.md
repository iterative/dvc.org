  Every month we share news, findings, interesting reads, community takeaways,
  and everything else along the way.

  Look here for updates about [DVC](https://dvc.org), our journey as a startup,
  projects by our users and big ideas about best practices in ML and data
  science.

Welcome to the February Heartbeat! This month's featured image is a DVC pipeline
[created by one of our users](https://medium.com/nlp-trend-and-review-en/use-dvc-to-version-control-ml-dl-models-bef61dbfe477),
which _we_ think resembles a valentine. Here are some more highlights from our
team and our community:

## News

**Our team is growing!** In early January, DVC gained two new folks: engineer
[Saugat Pachhai](https://github.com/skshetry) and data scientist
[Elle O'Brien](https://twitter.com/andronovhopf). Saugat, based in Nepal, will
be contributing to core DVC. Elle (that's me!), currently in San Francisco, will
be leading data science projects and outreach with DVC.

We're **gearing up for a spring full of talks** about DVC projects, including
new up-and-coming features for data cataloging and continuous integration. Here
are just a few events that have been added to our schedule:

-Elle O'Brien was recently accepted to give a keynote at
[Women in Data Science](https://www.widsconference.org/) San Diego on May 9. The
talk is called "Packaging data and machine learning models for sharing."

-Elle will also be speaking at [Div Ops](https://divops.org/), a new online
conference about (you guessed it) DevOps, on March 27.

Look out for more conference announcements soon- in our **brand new community
page!** We've [just launched a new hub](https://dvc.org/community) for sharing
events, goings-ons, and ways to contribute to DVC.

## From the community

Our users continue to put awesome things on the internet. Like this AI blogger
who isn't afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve.

It's cool how Musa puts DVC in context with libraries for model building. In a
way, the libraries that have made it easier than ever to iterate through
different model architectures have increased the need for reproducibility in
proportion.

Meanwhile in Germany, superusers Marcel Mikl and Bert Besser wrote
[another](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2019/03/walkthrough-dvc/) seriously
comprehensive article about DVC for Codecentric. Marcel and Bert walk readers
through the steps to **build a custom machine learning training pipeline with
remote computing resources** like GCP and AWS. It's an excellent guide to
configuring model training with attention to _automation_ and _collaboration_.
We give them 🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉 out of 5.

Here are a few more stories on our radar:

  of ML.

  Thanks for sharing- this is a lovely result. Oh, and last...

- **DVC is a job requirement**! We celebrated a small milestone when we stumbled
  .. across a listing for a data engineer to support R&D at
  [Elvie](https://www.elvie.com/en-us/), a maker of tech for women's health
  (pretty neat mission). The decorations on the job posting are ours 😎
