This is the very first issue of the DVC❤️Heartbeat. Every month we will be
sharing our news, findings, interesting reads, community takeaways, and
everything along the way.

Some of those are related to our brainchild [DVC](https://dvc.org) and its
journey. The others are a collection of exciting stories and ideas centered
around ML best practices and workflow.

## News and links

We read a ton of articles and posts every day and here are a few that caught our
eye. Well-written, offering a different perspective and definitely worth
checking.

## Discord gems

There are lots of hidden gems in our Discord community discussions. Sometimes
they are scattered all over the channels and hard to track down.

We will be sifting through the issues and discussions and share the most
interesting takeaways.

### Q: [Edit and define DVC files manually, in a Makefile style](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485586884165107734/541622187296161816)

There is no separate guide for that, but it is very straight forward. See
[DVC file format](/doc/user-guide/project-structure) description for how DVC
file looks inside in general. All `dvc add` or `dvc run` does is just computing
`md5` fields in it, that is all. You could write your DVC-file and then run
`dvc repro` that will run a command(if any) and compute all needed
checksums,[read more](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485586884165107734/541622187296161816).

### Q: [Best practices to define the code dependencies](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485586884165107734/547424240677158915)

There’s a ton of code in that project, and it’s very non-trivial to define the
code dependencies for my training stage — there are a lot of imports going on,
the training code is distributed across many modules,

### Q: [Azure data lake support](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485586884165107734/548495589428428801)

DVC officially only supports regular Azure blob storage. Gen1 Data Lake should
be accessible by the same interface, so configuring a regular azure remote for
DVC should work. Seems like Gen2 Data Lake
[has disable](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485586884165107734/550546413197590539)
blob API. If you know more details about the difference between Gen1 and Gen2,
feel free to join [our community](https://dvc.org/chat) and share this
knowledge.

### Q: [What licence DVC is released under](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/542390986299539459)

Apache 2.0. One of the [most common](https://opensource.org/licenses) and
permissible OSS licences.

### Q: Setting up S3 compatible remote

([Localstack](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/543445798868746278),
[wasabi](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/541466951474479115))

```dvc
$ dvc remote add upstream s3://my-bucket
$ dvc remote modify upstream region REGION_NAME
$ dvc remote modify upstream endpointurl <url>
```

Find and click the `S3 API compatible storage` on
[this page](https://dvc.org/doc/commands-reference/remote/add)

### Q: [Why DVC creates and updates `.gitignore` file?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/543914550173368332)

It adds your data files there, that are tracked by DVC, so that you don’t
accidentally add them to git as well you can open it with file editor of your
liking and see your data files listed there.

### Q: [Managing data and pipelines with DVC on HDFS](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/545562334983356426)

With DVC, you could connect your data sources from HDFS with your pipeline in
your local project, by simply specifying it as an external dependency. For
example let’s say your script `process.cmd` works on an input file on HDFS and
then downloads a result to your local workspace, then with DVC it could look
something like:

```dvc
$ dvc run -d hdfs://example.com/home/shared/input \
          -d process.cmd \
          -o output process.cmd
```
