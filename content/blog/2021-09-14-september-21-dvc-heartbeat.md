### Tezan Sahu's 4-part blog series

Welcome to September! We'll kick off this month's Community picks with a
four-part series by [**Tezan Sahu**](https://twitter.com/SahuTezan) on the
[**Fundamentals of MLOps.**](https://tezansahu.medium.com/fundamentals-of-mlops-part-1-a-gentle-introduction-to-mlops-1b184d2c32a8)
Tehan introduces readers to the core ideas behind taking the best practices of
DevOps and how they are being adapted to machine learning projects that deploy
large scale AI powered applications. The series includes:

- Part 1:
  [A Gentle Introduction to MLOps](https://tezansahu.medium.com/fundamentals-of-mlops-part-1-a-gentle-introduction-to-mlops-1b184d2c32a8)
- Part 2:
  [Data & Model Management with DVC](https://tezansahu.medium.com/fundamentals-of-mlops-part-2-data-model-management-with-dvc-6be2ad284ec4)
  We love this part best! ❤️😉
- Part 3:
  [MLExperimentation with PyCaret](https://tezansahu.medium.com/fundamentals-of-mlops-part-3-ml-experimentation-using-pycaret-747f14e4c28d)
- Part 4:
  [Tracking with MLFlow & Deployment with Fast API](https://tezansahu.medium.com/fundamentals-of-mlops-part-4-tracking-with-mlflow-deployment-with-fastapi-61614115436)

If you follow the steps through this series, you will learn how to build and
deploy an end-to-end ML project - all the steps leading to production!

### Miguel Méndez' Tutorial on DVC + MMdetection

This month [Miguel Méndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-mendez/) of
[Gradiant](https://www.gradiant.org/en//) brings us a guide on object detection
using the [MMdetection]() framework in conjunction with DVC to design the
pipeline, version models and monitor training progress. This follows his
[first guide](https://mmeendez8.github.io/2021/07/01/dvc-tutorial.html) covering
how to version your datasets with DVC, which we shared in the
[July Heartbeat.](https://dvc.org/blog/july-21-dvc-heartbeat)

In
[this new guide,](https://mmeendez8.github.io/2021/08/30/mmdet-dvc-tutorial.html)
you'll gain a thorough understanding of the steps, have access to
[his repo](https://github.com/mmeendez8/mmdetection_dvc) for the project, and
find his thoughts on scaling hyperparameter tuning through this
[open issue](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/5477#issuecomment-905440724)
about exeperiments that we are trying to resolve. Join the conversation! We'd
love your input!

## Hrittik Roy's Complete Intro to DVC

It was just a few short months ago when [Hrittik Roy]() joined us at his first
[DVC Office Hours](). Now he's written
[DVC (Git for Data): A Complete Tutorial](https://dev.to/hrittikhere/dvc-git-for-data-a-complete-intro-4626)
on DVC and how it solves the challenges of ML engineers. In this piece he takes
you through set up, pipeline and versioning, experiments and sharing through our
built in shared caching, so that you and your teammates can reduce resource use
when focusing on a subset of datasets as you move through your project.

## Yes, that's right, VS Code extension is coming!

[Paige Bailey](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige) let the cat out of the bag
[with her tweet](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/1430920240251035649?s=20)
about the developent of our VS Code extension for DVC. We're getting closer
every day! If you'd like to be a part of the beta testing (how could you not?)

## 📖 Docs Updates

As promised, we will be adding this section to the Heartbeat each month so that
you can stay in the know about the doc updates that will most impact your
workflows. You won't want to miss these...

### 📖 Fast and Secure Data Caching Hub

First up, a new doc on our
[Fast and Secure Data Caching Hub.](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/fast-data-caching-hub#fast-and-secure-data-caching-hub)
Checkout this doc to learn how DVC's built-in data caching lets you implement a
simple and efficient storage layer globally - FOR YOUR ENTIRE TEAM. This lets
you:

- ⏱ Speed data transfers from massive object stores currently on the cloud
- 💰 Pay only for fast access to frequently-used data
- 🙅🏻‍♂️ Avoid extra downloads and duplicating data
- ⚡️ Switch data inputs fast (without re-downloading) on a shared server used
  for machine learning experiments.

Status: Must read. 📖
