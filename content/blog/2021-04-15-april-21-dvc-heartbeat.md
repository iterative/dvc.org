## From the Community

We're starting with the community this month because it has been overflowing
with great content from our users. It's like we're on a sugar high!

## DVC used to help in Research published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences 🧑🏻‍🔬

[Anton Kulaga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonkulaga/) and his team used DVC
pipeline tracking in their research that selects genes connected with maximum
lifespan in mammals. You can check out the
[paper here](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/3/1073) as well as their
[pipeline use case here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kI1f62z0Opt8KD4Mf1yrYKftYLOZel3EjbfjDJiQQzg/edit)
and their [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/antonkulaga/yspecies)

See the diagram of the research below.👇🏼

## DAGsHub ❤️ DVC Colab Notebook

The DevRel team at [DAGsHub](https://dagshub.com/) made
[this cool notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JJIwAH0TBSY49um5s2FD0GEA6bw3SKrd#scrollTo=cjbAYZDfB3JB)
that trains a model to classify email as either 'Ham' or 'Spam.' The notebook
shows how to integrate DAGsHub remote storage with DVC to track code and data
files.
