## Chip Huyen: Designing Machine Learning Systems

[**Chip Huyen**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiphuyen/) just came out with a
new book with [O'Reilly](https://oreilly.com) entitled
[Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/).  
I'm not going to pontificate here; Chip Huyen wrote it, the reviews are shining,
need I say more?

## Jenny Abramov: An Agile Framework for AI Projects ‚Äî Development, QA, Deployment and Maintenance

[**Jenny Abramov**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyabramov/)
[wrote a piece](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-agile-framework-for-ai-projects-development-cbe115ba86a2)
in [Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) with the purpose to
present an "iterative-lifecycle framework," that is adapted to AI-centered
software. She outlines important considerations as you work through the
framework that depends on your use case, data, and business problem.

She suggests using DVC for your larger, more complex datasets and also about the
need for reproducibility in experimentation with which DVC can help you
[(see Technical Product Manager, Dave Berenbaum‚Äôs post on experiment versioning.)](https://dvc.org/blog/ml-experiment-versioning)

In addition, she discusses issues with quality assurance in deployment and the
maintenance of the system.

## MLOps Guide from INNOQ

[**Dr. Larysa Visengeriyeva**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larysavisenger/),
[**Anja Kammer,**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anja-kammer-berlin/)
[**Isabel B√§r,**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabel-b%C3%A4r-a89705213/)
[**Alexander Kniesz,**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-kniesz-656256197/)
and [**Michael Pl√∂d**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-ploed/) of
[**INNOQ**](https://www.innoq.com/en/) (a software development, strategy, and
technology consultancy) created
[this](https://ml-ops.org/content/mlops-principles) very thorough resource on
MLOps, going through all the principles and "iterative-incremental" steps of the
process (there's an iterative pattern here üòâ). The authors cover Automation,
Continuous X (hello CML and TPI), Versioning (hello DVC!), Experiments Tracking
(noted DVC here because indeed DVC does experiment tracking too!), Testing,
Monitoring, the "ML Test Score" System, Reproducibility, Modularity, ML-based
Software Delivery Metrics, and MLOps Principles and Best Practices. Definitely a
good resource for for MLOps and filled with more resources as well.

Also interesting from INNOQ is their
[Artist-in-residence program](https://www.innoq.com/en/artists/) created because
they "believe in the conscious reflection between technology and society" and
feel art is well suited for this refection. See the work below by Studio Waltz
Binaire based on the question: What traces do we leave behind with technology?

# Company News

## ICYMI: We released TPI! üéâ

On April 27th we released the latest offering to our tool ecosystem.

https://media.giphy.com/media/ut7lqhIfOscbjuU6YQ/giphy.gif

[Terraform Provider Iterative (TPI)](https://tpi.cml.dev) is a Terraform plugin
built with machine learning in mind. Full lifecycle management of computing
resources (including GPUs and respawning spot instances) from several cloud
vendors (AWS, Azure, GCP, K8s)... without needing to be a cloud expert.

- **Lower cost with spot recovery:** transparent data checkpoint/restore &
  auto-respawning of low-cost spot/preemptible instances
- **No cloud vendor lock-in:** switch between clouds with just one line thanks
  to unified abstraction
- **No waste:** auto-cleanup unused resources (terminate compute instances upon
  task completion/failure & remove storage upon download of results), pay only
  for what you use
- **Developer-first experience:** one-command data sync & code execution with no
  external server, making the cloud feel like a laptop

- ‚≠êÔ∏è [Star the Repo](https://tpi.cml.dev)

## üöÄ~~Mission Impossible~~ - We have a mission statement!

We did it! This year we surveyed the entire team to arrive at a mission
statement for Iterative. It was no small feat to decide on what it should be
given the early stage of our industry, the variety of our tools, and always a
struggle - figuring out the best and most concise way to convey these ideas (you
know our penchant for abbreviations). But we persevered and succeeded. Behold
Iterative's new mission statement:

> We deliver the best developer experience for machine learning teams by
> creating an ecosystem of open, modular ML tools.

As always the door is open for your feedback on how we can serve your needs
better!

## ODSC East

## Yet another tool comparison, imagine that!

https://media.giphy.com/media/lWa7aAo62YZLwtk3nj/giphy.gif

So each month I tell you about yet another post to help you attempt to make
sense of the vast MLOps tool space. Well, this month is no different. I mean you
could be new here, right? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [DoltHub](https://dolthub.com) tries to bring some
clarity
[with this piece](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-04-27-data-version-control/)
by comparing different data versioning tools and the intricacies of each. You do
your research. You know we're partial.

![Data Version Control tools](/uploads/images/2022-05-16/data-version-control.png '=800')
_Data Version control tools
([Source link](https://ml-ops.org/content/mlops-principles))_

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if all Data Science/AI teams need a role with the sole
responsibility of the job to keep up to date with all the new tooling and
changes/updates to existing tooling in the MLOps space and what might best work
for the team. What should this position be called? The best answer wins a DVC
t-shirt. See
[this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/DVCorg/status/1526286089551433728?s=20&t=nV3FQAso441MtvrckYAOJA)
to answer. (Hint: Funny answers will likely win üòâ). Deadline: May 31st. Pass it
around...

## Andrey Cheptsov: Notebooks and MLOps. Choose One.

[**Andrey Cheptsov**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrey-cheptsov/) writes
[a piece](https://mlopsfluff.dstack.ai/p/notebooks-and-mlops-choose-one?s=r)
pointing out how Jupyter Notebooks, while rightfully loved in data science work,
fail pretty miserably in a production environment and the reliance on them can
cause bad habits. He notes that he's found:

> For any ML model, the time spent in a Jupyter notebook is inversely
> proportional to its reproducibility. The reasons behind this rule are poor
> modularity and reusability of the code in notebooks, and poor integration with
> Git. - Andrey Cheptsov

He advocates for training your models using Python scripts, Git, and CI/CD to
automatically shift your foucus to creating reusable, testable code, and to use
tools like [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
to provide the interactivity of Jupyter notebooks. Sounds like a promising idea.

## Beyond ML

As noted above in our shiny new mission statement, our focus is to make tools
for machine learning teams. It has however come to our attention that more and
more users are using our tools for non-ML use cases.

[**Dror Speiser**](https://drorspei.wordpress.com/about/) writes about a non-ML
use case in
[A New Recipe for Idempotent Cloud Deployments](https://drorspei.wordpress.com/2021/09/15/a-new-recipe-for-reproducible-cloud-deployments/)
in which he provides a tutorial for doing just that with DVC.

The benefits of the approach are:

> 1. Changing one artifact‚Äôs code does not force rebuilding other artifacts,
>    even if you‚Äôre building on a new VM every time.
> 2. Changing only the deployment script won‚Äôt build any artifacts at all.
> 3. You have an artifact repository that just works.
> 4. Your Git history contains the hashes of all built artifacts.
> 5. You can look up any artifact using its hash.

We have opened up a #beyond-ml channel in our
[Discord Server](https://dvc.org/chat). Do stop by and chat about alternate uses
for our tools!
