Since its beta release in 2017, DVC has become an essential tool for many data
science teams. Its data versioning capabilities, reproducible pipelines, and
experiment tracking features are at the core of our ecosystem of open MLOps
tools.

Today we are proud to launch a new product that extends how ML teams can use
DVC: our extension for Visual Studio Code.

With this extension you get a full VS Code-native experimentation platform for
your machine learning projects. You can control datasets, run experiments, view
metrics, create plots, and much more. All in one place in your IDE.

# Why a VS Code extension?

We built DVC to expand upon the Git workflow. This approach has made it a
powerful tool that can easily be picked up by users familiar with Git. However,
a terminal does not always provide the most accessible user experience.
Moreover, while DVC provides many useful visualizations, a CLI tool can only
take things so far.

Therefore we wanted to incorporate DVC's functionality in a graphical interface.
[VS Code is the IDE of choice for many](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment),
including most of us here at Iterative. It seemed like the natural choice for a
platform to make DVC more versatile, accessible, and useful.

With this extension, we want to achieve the following:

- Move the ML experimentation workflow into your IDE
- Enhance existing visualizations and provide new ones
- Make DVC more accessible by hiding the complexity of the CLI

As data scientists, DVC is our toolbox. This extension turns VS Code into our
workshop.

# Features

Here are the main features that are available when you install the extension
right now:

## DVC View: experiments, parameters, metrics, and plots

The main feature of our extension is the DVC view, which provides a one-stop
shop for everything related to your machine learning experiments. You can run
new experiments from here, manage parameters, and compare both metrics and plots
for different models. Never has it been easier to analyze the results of your
experiments and find the best model.

## Source control management

On top of Git version control for your code, the source control view now lets
you manage datasets and models tracked by DVC without using the terminal. The
DVC panel shows you the state of the workspace, similarly to the familiar Git
panel. From here you can track artifacts and synchronize versions with your
remote repository.

## DVC tracked explorer

Resources tracked by DVC can be viewed and managed through the tracked explorer
view. See at a glance which datasets and models have been changed, and navigate
through all files contained in the DVC project(s) of your workspace.

## Command palette

The DVC extension makes extensive use of the Command Palette, reducing the need
to learn syntax by heart. Want to run a new experiment or pull data from your
remote repository? Give the word in the Command Palette and the DVC extension
will guide you along all required details.

# What's next?

We're excited that our VS Code extension is live and available to the public!
From here on out, we plan on making the extension even better with new features
such as pipeline (DAG) support,
[TPI](https://github.com/iterative/terraform-provider-iterative) integration for
remote execution, autocomplete for `dvc.yaml`, and parallel coordinate plots.

Of course, we'd love to hear what you are most looking forward to. Make sure to
give us feedback on what you'd like to see next!
