## Intro

Sharing experiments to compare machine learning models is important when you're
working with a team of engineers. You might need to get another opinion on an
experiments results. You might need to share a modified dataset or even share
the exact reproduction of a specific experiment.

Setting up DVC remotes in addition to your Git remotes lets you share all of the
data, code, and hyperparameters associated with each experiment so anyone can
pick up where you left off in the training process. We'll go through an example
of sharing an experiment with DVC remotes.

## Forking the project

To follow along, fork
[this repo](https://github.com/iterative/example-dvc-experiments) as one of your
own GitHub repos. That way you'll have pull access when we start working with
DVC. This repo has different tags that show the progression of the project and
you're welcome to check them out!

To get the branch we'll use in this post, you can run this command to clone your
forked repo. Make sure to replace `<your_github>` with your GitHub name.

```dvc
$ git clone git@github.com:<your_github>/example-dvc-experiments.git -b get-started
```

This project already has DVC files set up to run experiments, but if you want to
follow along with a project you're currently working on, make sure to check out
the steps to initialize a DVC pipeline in
[the Getting Started doc](https://dvc.org/doc/start).

## Setting up your DVC remotes

When you want to share the progress you've made with training your model, that
usually means you need to find a way to bundle the code, data, and
hyperparameters. This could be a complicated process if you're working with GBs
worth of data or you have a large number of hyperparameters.

That's one of the uses for DVC and why we'll be working with remotes. To start
with, make sure your GitHub remote is configured correctly. It should use the
SSH version of the URL. This is so DVC can authenticate the pushes and pulls
from GitHub it needs as part of experiment sharing.

The way DVC works is by storing custom Git refs in your repo with metadata that
defines the experiment. You can learn more about how DVC uses custom Git refs in
[this post](https://dvc.org/blog/experiment-refs).

Next, you'll need to set up a remote to your data location. This could be an AWS
S3 bucket, a Google Drive, or
[one of the other supported storage types](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/remote/add#supported-storage-types).

An important thing to note about the project we're working with is that there is
already a remote set up for you to pull from. You can see this in `.dvc/config`.
You'll need to set up a separate remote to push changes to since this remote
doesn't allow push access.

For this example, we'll be using a Google Drive folder as the remote to handle
pushing data. Now that you know what we're doing, let's run the command to set
up the DVC remote to push to.

```dvc
$ dvc remote add cloud_remote gdrive://1k6aUYWphOulJlXgq4XbfKExWGyymTpEl
```

This adds the remote storage named `cloud_remote` for DVC to track and we'll be
able to push and pull the exact code and data to reproduce any experiment. With
your Git remote and DVC remotes in place, you can start pulling data and
experiments from the cloud to your local machine.

_Note: Make sure you have write permissions to the Git remote!_

## Listing your remote experiments

When you're working with a team on an existing project, you might want to see
the experiments already in the remotes so you know what's available. To take a
look at the experiments we have run in the repo you forked, you'll have to set
up a new Git upsteam remote to reference the original repo. You can do that with
the following command.

```dvc
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/iterative/example-dvc-experiment
```

Now you can take a look at all of the experiments we have associated with this
repo with the following command.

```dvc
$ dvc exp list upstream --all
```

You'll get a list of all of the experiments across different Git branches that
have been pushed with DVC in the original repo. The output will look similar to
this.

```dvc
21784fa:
        exp-c8dcf
main:
        exp-b3667
        exp-d382a
```

Now you'll be able to pick which experiment you want to reproduce and start
testing with.

## Pulling experiments

If you're picking up an existing project, there will likely be a specific
experiment you'll get started with. To pull an experiment to your local machine,
you'll need an experiment id for the following command.

```dvc
$ dvc exp pull upstream exp-b3667
```

The `exp-b3667` comes from the `dvc exp list` command we ran earlier and now you
have all of the data and code associated with that experiment on your machine.

From here, you can start running new experiments with different models,
hyperparameters, or even datasets.

## Pushing experiments

Once you're done with your new experiments, you can push these to the Google
Drive remote we set up earlier. DVC handles both the GitHub and data storage
pushes with this command.

```dvc
$ dvc exp push origin exp-p4202
```

This will push the custom Git refs to your forked repo and it will push any
artifacts, like your data or model output, to the DVC remote location. If you
have checkpoints enabled, it will also push the checkpoints of an experiment.
Now you can easily share your work with other engineers to get feedback faster
and finish projects sooner.

## Conclusion

It's a lot easier to get help from someone on a project when you can share
everything with them. When you use DVC, you can bundle your data and code
changes for each experiment and push those to a remote for somebody else to
check out.
