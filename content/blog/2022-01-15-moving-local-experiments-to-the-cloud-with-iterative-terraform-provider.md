There's a number of good reasons one might want to train a machine learning
model locally. It's quick and easy to set up a new project on a local machine,
you don't have to worry about how much money you'll spend while using this
compute resource, your dataset may be a small sample, or you may want to start
with simple models. On top of that, a local machine is just deeply familiar, as
opposed to the multitude of available cloud services which can be intimidating
unless you have a decent background in DevOps.

Once you set up everything locally, and iterate through your code and
experiments enough times, you may come to a point where you have a need for a
more powerful compute resource to train a larger model, use more data, or both.
In other words, you may need to switch from training a model locally to training
it in a cloud environment. If you find yourself in this situation, I hope this
tutorial will help you by showing how to provision cloud infrastructure with
Terraform and run your existing training script on it.

## Getting Started

For this tutorial I have picked
[The BeeImage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jenny18/honey-bee-annotated-images)
which contains over 5,100 bee images annotated with location, date, time,
subspecies, health condition, caste, and pollen. I've downloaded the images,
created a project and trained a CNN model locally to classify different
subspecies. If you want to follow along, you can use your own data and training
code, or clone
[the example repo from GitHub](https://github.com/iterative/blog-tpi-bees).

Let's pretend that the model I trained is good enough so that I would like to
continue iterating on it in the cloud. Run more epochs? Change some
hyperparameters? Add more layers? The first question that we should ask
ourselves when we plan _The Big Move_ is "what exactly are we going to need to
train this model in a cloud environment?"

Some of the important puzzle pieces you already have locally. These are:

- Your training code. It is likely that you have a
  [whole pipeline](https://dvc.org/doc/start/data-pipelines) with multiple
  stages but for the sake of simplicity, mine is just a `train.py` script.
- Data
- Python environment with all required libraries.

In addition to that you will need an account with your cloud provider of choice.
In this tutorial I'll be provisioning infrastructure on Amazon Web Services
(AWS). You can create an AWS account yourself, or ask your DevOps team to
provide you with one. Make sure to
[store your authentication credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
(`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) in your system's environment
variables. Once you do, we can start the move with the help of Terraform and the
Iterative Terraform Provider.

## What is Terraform?

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) is an open-source infrastructure-as-code
tool that you'll need to
[download and install](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) for this
tutorial. With Terraform, you can create a configuration file in which you
declaratively describe what infrastructure you'd like to have. This means that
you do not need to write the instructions on what exact steps need to be taken.
Instead, you describe what your infrastructure should ultimately look like.
Behind the scenes, Terraform will figure out what needs to be done. If you've
cloned the repo, you'll find the `main.tf`file in the root of the project --
that's where we will be configuring Terraform.

## Iterative Terraform Provider

Terraform can orchestrate a plethora of various resources for you, but for the
majority of projects you only need a few. That's why instead of shipping all the
integrations in one bundle, you install a barebones Terraform distribution and
then plug in support for whatever resources you need with so-called
[_providers_](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/how-terraform-works.html).
For this tutorial we will only need
[Iterative Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/iterative/iterative/latest).
It enables full lifecycle management of computing resources for machine learning
pipelines from AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and more. The
Iterative Provider has a couple of advantages for machine learning pipelines.
Namely,

- The configuration for various cloud compute providers with Iterative Provider
  will be nearly identical, so you can easily migrate from one cloud provider to
  another, if you want to.
- It is designed not only to provision infrastructure but to execute your
  scripts on it too, all via a single configuration.
- It helps to sync data between your local machine and a remote one.
- Once your training is complete, the remote resources will be terminated,
  avoiding unused machines quietly ramping up costs.

To start using the Iterative Provider we need to let Terraform know about it by
adding the following in our `main.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
    required_providers {
      iterative = { source = "iterative/iterative", version = ">= 0.9.9" }
      }
}

provider "iterative" {}
```

Once you describe what providers you'll be using in your `main.tf`, run the
`terraform init` command. If you have cloned the example repo, you should run
this command before doing anything else. This will initialize your working
directory and download the required provider.

## Configuring `iterative_task`

The Iterative Provider offers a single resource called `iterative_task` that
we'll need to configure. This resource will:

1. Create cloud resources (storage, machines) for the task.
2. If specified, upload a directory to the cloud storage.
3. Run the given script until completion or timeout in the cloud.
4. Download results.
5. Automatically terminate compute resources upon task completion.

This is exactly what we need to run a model training process! Let's see how we
can configure the `iterative_task` in the same `main.tf` file. First, I'll show
you what my configuration file looks like, and then we'll unpack what's going on
here:

```hcl
terraform {
    required_providers {
      iterative = { source = "iterative/iterative", version = ">= 0.9.9" }
      }
}

provider "iterative" {}

resource "iterative_task" "tpi-examples-basic" {
    name      = "tpi-examples-basic"
    cloud     = "aws"
    region    = "us-east-2"
    machine   = "l+k80"

    workdir { input = "." }
    script = <<-END
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3-pip
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 src/train.py
    END
}
```

Every Terraform resource needs a name, and mine is called `tpi-examples-basic`
here. This name is only used within the configuration file and it can be
whatever you want. Inside of the resource block, we specify the
[resource arguments](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/iterative/iterative/latest/docs/resources/task#argument-reference):

- _name_ (**required**): this is a name that will be used to set up the cloud
  resources, and it does not have to be the same as the `iterative_task` name.
  However, try to make it unique, it shouldnâ€™t be in conflict with names of
  existing cloud resources.
- _cloud_ (**required**): cloud provider to run the task on. This can be `aws`,
  `gcp`, `az`, or `k8s`.
- _region_: you can choose the region where the compute resources should be
  allocated.
- _machine_: if you know the exact kind of machine that you'd like to use, you
  can specify it here. Alternatively, the Iterative Provider offers some common
  machine types which are roughly the same for all supported clouds. For
  example,
  [l+k80](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/iterative/iterative/latest/docs/resources/task#l+k80)
  stands for a "Large, with (at least) 12 CPU cores, 112 GB of RAM and 2 GPU
  devices".
- _workdir_: Specify a directory on your local machine relative to your project
  folder which you would like to sync with the remote machine. This way you can
  share your whole project or parts of it with a remote machine. In my example,
  I am sharing the whole project.
- _script_ (**required)**: This is where the Iterative Provider's magic happens,
  i.e. this is where we define a script that should be run on a provisioned
  machine.

Take a look at the script. In the simplest scenario, all we need to do on a new
machine to run the training script is to set up the Python environment with
required libraries. If you simply want to train your model on a machine with
more memory, this may be enough. However, if you want your training code to
leverage GPUs, the script will look a bit different.

## Training with GPU

There are several ways you can leverage GPU devices on a remote machine. You can
install all the required drivers and dependencies "manually" via a script, you
can use an existing Docker image or build your own, or, in the case of AWS, you
can take advantage of an
[existing pre-configured Deep Learning AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/options.html).
In this tutorial, we'll use an AMI, as it is the quickest way to start using
GPUs on an AWS EC2 machine.

```hcl
...
resource "iterative_task" "tpi-examples-gpu" {
    name      = "ami-gpu-example"
    cloud     = "aws"
    region    = "us-east-2"
    machine   = "l+k80"
    disk_size = "130"
    image     = "ubuntu@898082745236:x86_64:Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) Version 54.0"

    workdir { input = "." }
    script = <<-END
    #!/bin/bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 src/train.py
    END
}
```

To use a Deep Learning AMI, you need to configure it via the `image` argument
that has the following structure: `{user}@{owner}:{architecture}:{name}`. You
can learn more about AMIs in the official
[AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html).

The Deep Learning image that you choose may require larger disk size than the
provided default, so you may need to increase it. The image I picked expectes
volume of at least 130 GB, and I can configure this in the `disk_size` argument.

You may also notice that my script got a bit shorter. This is because I no
longer need to install Python, and only need to make sure to have my
requirements met.

## Readyâ€¦ Setâ€¦ Apply!

Whether you want to go with the basic example, or the GPU-enabled training, you
can run `terraform plan` to review what steps Terraform is going to take to make
your desired infrastructure materialize. Don't worry, nothing is actually done
at this point, but it's a good way to check for potential issues in the
configuration.

If there are no issues, run `terraform apply` to execute the actions proposed in
the Terraform plan. You'll need to type `yes` to confirm that you indeed would
like the plan to be executed.

At this point you can get a cup of your favourite beverage, and let the
Iterative Provider work its magic together with Terraform. They will allocate a
remote machine for you, set up the environment and run your `train.py`. Once the
script finishes, the machine will be terminated.

You can monitor what's going on by running
`terraform refresh && terraform show`. Once you see that the task has
successfully finished, go ahead and run `terraform destroy` to destroy all
remote objects managed by your configuration and sync back your shared files. If
you write metrics to a file (e.g. `metrics.json`), then you'll get the new
metrics synced back to your local machine.

Now if you want to try another experiment, you can change your code, run
`terraform apply` again, and when the training is finished, commit your code
together with the updated `metrics.json`. This can help you move from
prototyping locally to leveraging more powerful cloud machines without the
hassle of full MLOps setup. At the same time, once you're ready to start working
on your
[production pipelines and CI/CD](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/ci-cd-for-machine-learning),
this should also make the transition smoother.

In this tutorial we have covered the simplest example with no GPU, and one that
involves leveraging GPUs with the help of a pre-configured Deep Learning AMI. In
many cases, productionizing your workflows would require creating your own
Docker image that you could use both for prototyping and for CI/CD workflows. If
you'd like to learn how to create your own Docker images and use them with the
Iterative Terraform provider, let us know and we'll write another tutorial about
that!
