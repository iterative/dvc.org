If you are not in SF on this date and happen to be in Europe — don’t miss the
PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2019 joint event on October 9–11. We cannot make it to
Berlin this year, but we were thrilled to discover 2 independent talks featuring
DVC by
[Alessia Marcolini](https://pyvideo.org/pydata-berlin-2019/version-control-for-data-science.html)
and
[Katharina Rasch](https://pyvideo.org/pydata-berlin-2019/tools-that-help-you-get-your-experiments-under-control.html).

Some other highlights of the end of summer:

- Our users and contributors keep creating fantastic pieces of content around
  DVC (sharing some links below, but it’s only a fraction of what we have in
  stock — can’t be more happy and humbled about it!).

- We’ve reached 79 contributors to
  [DVC core project](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) and 74 contributors to
  [DVC documentation](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org) (and have something
  special in mind to celebrate our 100th contributors).

- We enjoyed working with all the talented
  [Google Season of docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)
  applicants and now moving to the next stage with our chosen tech writer
  [Dashamir Hoxha](http://dashohoxha.fs.al/).

- We’ve crossed the 3,000 stars mark on Github
  ([over 3,500 now](https://github.com/iterative/dvc)). Thank you for your
  support!

- We’ve had great time at the
  [Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america-2019/program/)
  by Linux foundation in San Diego — speaking on stage, running a booth and
  chatting with all the amazing open-source crowd out there.

## Discord gems

There are lots of hidden gems in our Discord community discussions. Sometimes
they are scattered all over the channels and hard to track down.

We are sifting through the issues and discussions and share with you the most
interesting takeaways.

### Q: I’m getting an error message while trying to use AWS S3 storage: `ERROR: failed to push data to the cloud — Unable to locate credentials.` [Any ideas what’s happening?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/587792932061577218)

Most likely you haven’t configured your S3 credentials/AWS account yet. Please,
read the full documentation on the AWS website. The short version of what should
be done is the following:

- [Create your AWS account.](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html)

- Log in to your AWS Management Console.

- Click on your user name at the top right of the page.

- Click on the Security Credentials link from the drop-down menu.

- Find the Access Credentials section, and copy the latest `Access Key ID`.

- Click on the Show link in the same row, and copy the `Secret Access Key`.

Follow
[this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
to setup your environment.

### Q: I added data with `dvc add` or `dvc run` and see that it takes twice what it was before (with `du` command). [Does it mean that DVC copies data that is added under its control? How do I prevent this from happening?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/595402051203235861)

To give a short summary — by default, DVC copies the files from your working
directory to the cache (this is for safety reasons, it is better to duplicate
the data). If you have reflinks (copy-on-write) enabled on your file system, DVC
will use that method — which is as safe as copying. You can also configure DVC
to use hardlinks/symlinks to save some space and time, but it will require
enabling the protected mode (making data files in workspace read-only). Read
more details [here](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/large-dataset-optimization).

### Q: [How concurrent-friendly is the cache? And different remotes? Is it safe to have several containers/nodes fill the same cache at the same time?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/599345778703597568)

It is safe and a very common use case for DVC to have a shared cache. Please,
check [this thread](https://discuss.dvc.org/t/share-nas-data-in-server/180/12),
for example.

### Q:[What is the proper way to exit the ASCII visualization?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/603890677176336394) (when you run `dvc pipeline show` command).

See this
[document](https://dvc.org/doc/commands-reference/pipeline/show#options). To
navigate, use arrows or W, A, S, D keys. To exit, press Q.

### Q: [Is there an issue if I set my `cache.s3` external cache to my default remote?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/606197026488844338) I don’t quite understand what an external cache is for other than I have to have it for external outputs.

Short answer is that we would suggest keeping them separately to avoid possible
checksum overlaps. Checksum on S3 might theoretically overlap with our checksums
(with the content of the file being different), so it could be dangerous. The
chances of losing data are pretty slim, but we would not risk it. Right now, we
are working on making sure there are no possible overlapping.

### Q: [What’s the right procedure to move a step .dvc file around the project?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/606425815139221504)

Assuming the file was created with `dvc run`. There are few possible ways.
Obvious one is to delete the file and create a new one with
`dvc run --no-exec -f file/path/and/name.dvc`. Another possibility is to
rename/move and then edit manually. See
[this document](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) that describes
how DVC-files are organized. No matter what method you use, you can run
`dvc commit file.dvc` to save changes without running the command again.

### Q: [`dvc status` doesn’t seem to report things that need to be dvc pushed, is that by design?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/606917839688957952)

You should try with dvc status `--cloud` or `dvc status --remote <your-remote>`
to compare your local cache with a remote one, by default it only compares the
“working directory” with your local cache (to check whether something should be
reproduced and saved or not).

### Q: [What kind of files can you put into `dvc metrics`?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/608701494035873792)

The file could be in any format, `dvc metrics` show will try to interpret the
format and output it in the best possible way. Also, if you are using `csv` or
`json`, you can use the `--xpath` flag to query specific measurements. **In
general, you can make any file a metric file and put any content into it, DVC is
not opinionated about it.** Usually though these are files that measures the
performance/accuracy of your model and captures configuration of experiments.
The idea is to use `dvc metrics show` to display all your metrics across
experiments so you can make decisions of which combination (of features,
parameters, algorithms, architecture, etc.) works the best.

### Q: [Does DVC take into account the timestamp of a file or is the MD5 only depends on the files actual/bits content?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/613639458000207902)

DVC takes into account only content (bits) of a file to calculate hashes that
are saved into DVC-files.

### Q: [Similar to `dvc gc` is there a command to garbage collect from the remote?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/616421757808541721)

`dvc gc --remote NAME` is doing this, but you should be extra careful, because
it will remove everything that is not currently “in use” (by the working
directory). Also, please check this
[issue](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/2325) — semantics of this
command might have changed by the time you read this.

### Q: [How do I use and configure remote storage on IBM Cloud Object Storage?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/591237578209099786)

Since it’s S3 compatible, specifying `endpointurl` (exact URL depends on the
[region](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints))
is the way to go:

```dvc
$ dvc remote add -d mybucket s3://path/to/dir
$ dvc remote modify mybucket \
                    endpointurl \
                    https://s3.eu.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud
```

### Q: [How can I push data from client to google cloud bucket using DVC?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/592958360903483403). Just want to know how can i set the credentials.

You can do it by setting environment variable pointing to yours credentials
path, like:

```dvc
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/credentials
```

It is also possible to set this variable via `dvc config`:

```dvc
$ dvc remote modify myremote credentialpath /path/to/my/creds
```

where `myremote` is your remote name.
