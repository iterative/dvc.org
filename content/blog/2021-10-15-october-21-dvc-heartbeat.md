## Ricardo Manh√£es Savii - Trying to turn Machine Learning into value

If we can't turn machine learning into value, what good are we?
[**Ricardo Manh√£es Savii**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardoms/)
[wrote a piece](https://medium.com/@ricardosavii/trying-to-turn-machine-learning-into-value-de9f28cde056)
in [Medium](https://medium.com/) where he tackles how to technically and
visually define the steps to deliver an Intelligent System with the same level
of best practice maturity as software development has today. He combines and
synthesizes the ideas of some of the best known thinkers in the space to build a
thorough architecture of machine learning best practices. You won't want to miss
this post and wrap your head around these diagrams!

## Rappibank How to build an efficient machine learing project workflow

Continuing the theme of ML workflow Complexity
[Daniel Baena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/data-box-science/) wrote a
[great overview and tutorial piece](https://medium.com/rappibank/how-to-build-an-efficient-machine-learning-project-workflow-using-data-version-control-dvc-aaeaa9cfb79b)
outlining the challenges that his team at
[Rappi Bank](https://bank.rappi.com.br/) encountered and found ways to solve
with DVC.

- confusing experiment files with different names?
- disjointed messaging about training and models and dataset changes?
- holdinging in your head or own notes progress that is not visible to the rest
  of the team?
- heavy run and re-run times without a modularized system? Daniel show how all
  of these things can be solved using DVC.
