  Today we're launching Continuous Machine Learning (CML), a new open-source
  project for CI/CD with ML. Use it to automate parts of your ML workflow,
  including model training and evaluation, comparing ML experiments across your
  project history, and monitoring changing datasets. Let's bring the power of
  DevOps to ML or MLOps.

## CI/CD for machine learning

Today, the DVC team is releasing a new open-source project called Continuous
Machine Learning, or CML (https://cml.dev) to mainstream the best engineering
practices of CI/CD to AI and ML teams. CML helps to organize MLOps
infrastructure on top of the traditional software engineering stack instead of
creating separate AI platforms.

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) is a widely-used software
engineering practice. It's a validated approach to increasing the agility of
software development without sacrificing stability. **But why haven't CI/CD
practices taken root in machine learning and data science so far?**

We see three substantial technical barriers to using standard CI systems with
machine learning projects:

1. **Data dependencies.** In ML, data plays a similar role as code: ML results
   critically depend on datasets, and changes in data need to trigger feedback
   just like changes in source code. Furthermore, multi-GB datasets are
   challenging to manage with Git-centric CI systems.
2. **Metrics-driven.** The traditional software engineering idea of pass/fail
   tests does not apply in ML. As an example, `+0.72% accuracy` and
   `-0.35% precision` does not answer the question if the ML model is good or
   not. Detailed reports with metrics and plots are needed to make a good/bad
   model discussion
3. **CPU/GPU resources**. ML training often requires more resources to train
   then is typical to have in CI/CD runners. CI/CD must be connected with cloud
   computing instances or Kubernetes clusters for ML training.

## CI/CD for ML is the next step for the DVC team

Since the beginning, our motivation has been helping ML teams benefit from
DevOps. We started DVC because we knew that data management would be a crucial
bottleneck, and sure enough, DVC was a big step towards making pipelines and
experiments manageable and reproducible. But conversations with our community
have brought us to one conclusion again and again: CI/CD for ML is the holy
grail.

Over the last 3 years, we've reached some big milestones:

1. We built DVC to address the ML data management problem. Recently, we
   [released DVC 1.0](https://dvc.org/blog/dvc-1-0-release), marking a new and
   more stable era for our API.
2. DVC has become a core part of many ML team's daily operations. The latest
   [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools)
   says:

   _"... it [DVC] has become a favorite tool for managing experiments in machine
   learning (ML) projects. Since it's based on Git, DVC is a familiar
   environment for software developers to bring their engineering practices to
   ML practice."_

3. An extraordinary team and community have emerged around DVC:
   - 15 employees in our organization https://iterative.ai
   - 100+ open-source contributors to DVC https://github.com/iterative/dvc and
     another 100+ open-source contributors to docs
     https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org
   - 2000+ community members in our Discord https://dvc.org/chat and GitHub
     issue tracker https://github.com/iterative/dvc
   - 4000+ regular users of DVC

Now that DVC is maturing, we're ready to take the next step: we want to
revolutionize the ML development processes. We want ML experiments to have
greater visibility to teammates, shorter feedback loops, and more
reproducibility. We want teams to spend less time managing their computing
resources and experiments, and more time building value. The goal is to extend
the amazing results of DevOps from software development to ML and MLOps.

## _Continuous Machine Learning_ release

Today, we're releasing an open-source project https://cml.dev to close the gap
between machine learning and software development practices.

CML is a library of functions used inside CI/CD runners to make ML compatible
with **GitHub Actions** and **GitLab CI**. We've created functions to:

1. Generate informative reports on every Pull/Merge Request with metrics, plots,
   and hyperparameters changes.
2. Provision GPU\CPU resources from cloud service providers (**AWS, GCP, Azure,
   Ali**) and deploy CI runners using
   [Docker Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine).
3. Bring datasets from cloud storage to runners (using **DVC**) for model
   training, as well as save the resulting model in cloud storage.

The workflow and visual reports are customizable by modifying the CI
configuration file in your GitHub `./github/workflows/*.yaml` or GitLab
`.gitlab-ci.yml` project. Use CML functions in conjunction with your own ML
model training and testing scripts to create your own automated workflow and
reporting system.

```yaml
# GitLab workflow in '.gitlab-ci.yml' file

stages:
  - cml_run

cml:
  stage: cml_run
  image: dvcorg/cml-py3:latest
  script:
    - dvc pull data --run-cache

    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - dvc repro

    # Compare metrics to master
    - git fetch --prune
    - dvc metrics diff --show-md master >> report.md

    # Visualize loss function diff
    - dvc plots diff --target loss.csv --show-vega master > vega.json
    - vl2png vega.json | cml-publish --md >> report.md
    - dvc push data --run-cache
    - cml-send-comment report.md
```

In this example all the CML functions are defined in the **docker images** that
is used in the workflow - `dvcorg/cml-py3`. Users can specify any docker image.
The only restriction is that the CML library need to be installed to enable all
the CML commands for the reporting and graphs:

```bash
npm i @dvcorg/cml
```

Examples of docker images can be found in `docker` directory of the CML the
repository: [CML repository](https://github.com/iterative/cml).

As you can see, CML is based on the assumption that MLOps can work with
traditional engineering tools. It shouldn't require an entirely separate
platform. We're excited about a world where DevOps practitioners can work
fluently on both software and ML aspects of a project.

## The relationship between CML and DVC

CML and DVC are related projects under the umbrella of the same team, but will
have separate websites and independent development. The CML project is hosted on
a new web site: https://cml.dev. The source code and issue tracker is on GitHub:
https://github.com/iterative/cml

For support and communications, the DVC Discord server is still the place to go:
https://dvc.org/chat We've made a new `#cml` channel there to discuss CML, CI/CD
for ML and other MLOps related questions.

## Conclusion

With the rise of AI/ML teams and ML platforms in addition to the software
engineering stack, we believe that the industry needs a single technology stack
to work with software as well as AI projects. A simple layer of a tool is
required to close the gap between AI projects and software projects to fit them
into the existing stack and CML is the way to make it.

Our philosophy is that ML projects, and MLOps practices, should be built on top
of traditional engineering tools and not as a separate stack. A simple layer of
tools will be required to close the gap, and CML is part of this ecosystem. We
think this is the future of MLOps.

As always, thanks for reading and for being part of the DVC community. We'd love
to hear what you think about CML. Please be in touch on
