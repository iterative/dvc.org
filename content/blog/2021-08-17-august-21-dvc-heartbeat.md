# It's all about that Data!

# From the Community

This month we are seeing the progression of a couple of pieces from the
[June Heartbeat](https://media.giphy.com/media/62HBhssMOgdJUZQp1X/giphy.gif) as
well as checking out a use case, tool stack, and some great tutorials of our
Community members.

## LJ Miranda synthesizes the MLOps space once again!

[LJ Miranda](https://twitter.com/ljvmiranda921) writes another amazing article
after the series of articles he wrote covering the MLOps tools landscape we
covered in the June Heartbeat. This time he focuses on the wave of data-centric
focus taking over the space giving a review of the methods, approaches, and
techniques to ensure quality data for ML projects. If the adroit summaries of
complex concepts doesn't thrill you, the links to no less than 63 (😱) resources
will get you on your way to data-centric nirvana.

## Neda Sultova's Comparison of DVC, MLFlow and Metaflow

Also covered in the June Hearbeat was
[Neda Sultova's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neda-sultova-597a811a8/) piece on
the rubric she is using to decide on the what MLOps tools to use for the teams
at [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/). This
[next article](https://medium.com/geekculture/comparing-metaflow-mlflow-and-dvc-e84be6db2e2)
reviews her research into DVC, MLFlow and Metaflow and offers a thorough
analysis of the tools across multiple dimensions. Beyond the article, check out
her [MLOps Comparison repository](https://github.com/hzdr/mlops_comparison) as
well as her
[Comparison Table](https://github.com/hzdr/mlops_comparison/blob/master/Content/Comparison_table.pdf).
They will not disappoint!

## Amit Kulkarni's Tutorials

Writing for the
[Analytics Vidhya Data Science Blogathon,](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/data-science-blogathon-9/#LeaderBoard)
[Amit Kulkarni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitvkulkarni2/) created two
tutorials on DVC.  
[Tracking ML Experiments with Data Version Control](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/mlops-tracking-ml-experiments-with-data-version-control/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter)
reviews DVC and takes you through getting started, setup, fetching data and
pre-processing, and the steps of an ML project. Next it sets up DVC, the
pipeline, and shows how to run model metrics and plots. In
[MLOps| Versioning with Git & DVC,](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/mlops-versioning-datasets-with-git-dvc/)
Amit continues with an explanation how data and model versioning works with
Github paired with DVC.

In a previous article entitled
[Bring DevOps to Data Science with MLOps](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/04/bring-devops-to-data-science-with-continuous-mlops/)
Amit walks through a tutorial using CML to bring CI/CD functionality to your ML
project and automate the process. All great posts to check out!👇🏼

## Andreas Malekos' MLOps Tool Stack at Continuum Industries

Last but not least, we bring you a great article from
[Andreas Malekos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasmalekos/), Chief Scientist
at [Continuum Industries](https://www.continuum.industries/). In
[the post](https://neptune.ai/blog/mlops-tool-stack-continuum-industries) he
outlines the tool stack and MLOps platform they use to do their work automating
and optimizing the design of linear infrastructure assets like water pipelines,
overhead transmission lines, subsea power lines, or telecommunication cables.

Amongst their tool stack are DVC and CML, and the article outlines what they
like (!🙈Spoiler alert🙊! DVC making repeatability achievable) and the things
that they don't like that still need to be improved.

# DVC News

Though the team has been taking some vacation time in the last month, there's
still a lot going on!

## Docs Updates

This month we are introducing docs updates so that you will always be aware of
what has changed as our open source projects mature.

Our docs team made up of
[Jorge Orpinel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgeorpinel/),
[Emre Şahin](https://emresahin.net), [Casper de la Costa](https://www.cdcl.ml),
and
[David de la Iglesia-Castro,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-de-la-iglesia-castro-b4b67b20a/)
has been hard at work updating our docs to make sure you have what you need to
be successful using our tools! Updates include:

- Complete [DVCLive docs](https://dvc.org/doc/dvclive/user-guide)
- We have a new [Glossary page](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/glossary) and a
  first Basic Concepts page
  ([_DVC Workspace_](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/basic-concepts/workspace))
- [CML Docs migration to CML.Dev](https://cml.dev/doc)
- [Added Videos to Get Started: Metrics and Experiments pages](https://dvc.org/doc/start)
  and
  [Checkpoints Guide](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/checkpoints)
- Authentication examples for
  [Azure Blob remote storage](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/remote/modify#example-some-azure-authentication-methods)
  from Community member @meierale ❤️

## Batuhan Taskaya's Refactor Project hits First Page in HackerNews!

A [Refactor Project](https://github.com/isidentical/refactor) created by team
Member [Batuhan Taskaya](https://twitter.com/isidentical) (AKA @isidentical),
was shared by someone on HackerNews and made it to the main page! You can
[catch all the comments here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28027016)!

Explanation of the project:

> refactor is an end-to-end refactoring framework that is built on top of the
> 'simple but effective refactorings' assumption. It is much easier to write a
> simple script with it rather than trying to figure out what sort of a regex
> you need in order to replace a pattern (if it is even matchable with regexes).

> Every refactoring rule offers a single entrypoint, match(), where they accept
> an AST node (from the ast module in the standard library) and respond with
> either returning an action to refactor or nothing. If the rule succeeds on the
> input, then the returned action will build a replacement node and refactor
> will simply replace the code segment that belong to the input with the new
> version.

Way to go Batuhan! 🚀
