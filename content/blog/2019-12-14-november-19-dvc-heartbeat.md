The past few months have been so busy and full of great events! We love how
involved our community is and can’t wait to share more with you:

- We have organized our very first
  [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Machine-Learning-Meetup/events/264846847/)!
  So many great conversations, new use cases and insights! Many thanks to
  [Dan Fischetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-fischetti-4a6592bb/) from
  [Standard Cognition](https://standard.ai/), who joined our Dmitry Petrov on
  stage. Watch the recording here.

- DVC became part of the default
  [Homebrew formulae](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/dvc)! So now you can
  install it as easy as `brew install dvc`!

- We helped 2 aspiring speakers deliver their very first conference talks.
  [Kurian Benoy](https://twitter.com/kurianbenoy2/status/1183427495342694401?s=20)
  was speaking at [PyconIndia](https://in.pycon.org/2019/) and
  [Aman Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman-sharma606/) was speaking at
  [SciPyIndia](https://scipy.in/2019#speakers). **Supporting speakers is
  something we are passionate about and if you ever wanted to give a talk on a
  DVC-related topic — we are here to help, just
  [let us know](https://dvc.org/support)!**

## Discord gems

There are lots of hidden gems in our Discord community discussions. Sometimes
they are scattered all over the channels and hard to track down.

We are sifting through the issues and discussions and share with you the most
interesting takeaways.

### Q: When you do a `dvc import` you get the state of the data in the original repo at that moment in time from that repo, right? [The overall state of that repo (e.g. Git `commit id` (hash)) is not preserved upon import, right?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/618744949277458462)

On the contrary, DVC relies on Git `commit id` (hash) to determine the state of
the data as well as code. Git `commit id` (hash) is saved in DVC file upon
import, data itself is copied/downloaded into DVC repo cache but would not be
pushed to the remote — DVC does not create duplicates. There is a command to
advance/update it when it’s needed — `dvc update`. Git commit hash saved to
provide reproducibility. Even if the source repo `HEAD` has changed your import
stays the same until you run `dvc update` or redo `dvc import`.

### Q: I’m trying to understand if DVC is an appropriate solution for storing data under GDPR requirements. [That means that permanent deletion of files with sensitive data needs to be fully supported.](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/621057268145848340)

Yes, in this sense DVC is not very different from using bare S3, SSH or any
other storage where you can go and just delete data. DVC can give a bit of
overhead to locate a specific file to delete, but otherwise it’s all the same
you will be able to delete any file you want. Read more details in
[this discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/621062105524862987).

### Q: [Is there anyway to get the remote url for specific DVC-files?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/621591769766821888) Say, I have a DVC-file `foo.png.dvc` — is there a command that will show the remote url, something like `dvc get-remote-url foo.png.dvc` which will return e.g. the Azure url to download.

There is no special command for that, but if you are using Python, you could use
our API specifically designed for that:

```python
from dvc.api import get_url

url = get_url(path,
              repo="https://github.com/user/proj",
              rev="mybranch")
```

so, you could as well use this from CLI as a wrapper command.

### Q: [Can DVC be integrated with MS Active Directory (AD) authentication for controlling access?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/619244714071425035) The GDPR requirements would force me to use such a system to manage access.

Short answer: no (as of the date of publishing this Heartbeat issue) Good news —
it should be very easy to add, so we would welcome a contribution :) Azure has a
connection argument for AD — quick googling shows this
[library](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-python),
which is what probably needed.

### Q: [How do I uninstall DVC from Mac installed as a package?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/625124341201502209)

When installing using `plain.pkg` it is a bit tricky to uninstall, so we usually
recommend using things like brew cask instead if you really need the binary
package. Try to run these commands:

```dvc
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/dvc
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/dvc
$ sudo pkgutil --forget com.iterative.dvc
```

to uninstall the package.

### Q: We are using SSH remote to store data, but the problem is that everyone within the project has different username on the remote machine and thus we cannot set it in the config file (that is committed to Git). [Is there a way to add just host and path, without the username?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/619420070111608848)

Yes, you should use `--local` or `--global` config options to set user per
project or per use machine without sharing (committing) them to Git:

```dvc
$ dvc remote modify myremote —local user myuser
```

or

```dvc
$ dvc remote modify myremote —global user myuser
```

### Q: [I still get the `SSL ERROR` when I try to perform a dvc push with or without `use_ssl = false`](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/628227197592797191)?

A simple environment variable like this:

```dvc
$ export AWS_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/cert/cert.crt dvc push
```

should do the trick for now, we plan to fix the ca_bundle option soon.

### Q: I have just finished a lengthy `dvc repro` and I’m happy with the result. However, I realized that I didn’t specify a dependency which I needed (and obviously is used in the computation). [Can I somehow fix it?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/620572187841265675)

Add the dependency to the stage file without rerunning/reproducing the stage.
This is not needed as this additional dependency hasn’t changed.

You would need to edit the DVC-file. In the deps section add:

```yaml
-path: not/included/file/path
```

and run `dvc commit file.dvc` to save changes w/o running the pipeline again.
See an example
[here](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/620641530075414570).

### Q: For some reason [we need to always specify the remote name when doing a `dvc push`](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/485596304961962003/629704961868955648) e.g., `dvc push -r upstream` as opposed to `dvc push` (mind no additional arguments).

You can mark a “default” remote:

```dvc
$ dvc remote add -d remote /path/to/my/main/remote
```

then, `dvc push` (and other commands like `dvc pull`) will know to push to the
default

### Q: [If I want stage B to run after stage A, but the stage A has no output, can I specify A’s DVC-file as B’s dependency?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/620715145374466048)

No, at least at the time of publishing this. You could use a phony output
though. E.g. make the stage A output some dummy file and make B depend on it.
Please, consider creating or upvoting a relevant issue on our Github if you’d
this to be implemented.

### Q: I’m just getting started with DVC, but I’d like to use it for multiple developers to access the data and share models and code. [I do own the server, but I’m not sure how to use DVC with SSH remote?](https://discordapp.com/channels/485586884165107732/563406153334128681/598867829785362452)

Please, refer to
[this answer](https://discuss.dvc.org/t/how-do-i-use-dvc-with-ssh-remote/279/2)
on the DVC forum and check the documentation for the
[`dvc remote add`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/remote/add) and
[`dvc remote modify`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/remote/modify)
commands to see more options and details.
