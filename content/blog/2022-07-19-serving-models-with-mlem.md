Training a machine learning model is only one step in the process of getting
something useful out to end-users. When it's time to deploy the model to
production, there are a number of approaches you can take depending on the goal
of the machine learning project. That might mean getting the model ready to
respond to real-time queries coming from an API or batch processing predictions,
for example.

Either way, you'll need to save your trained and validated model in a format
that's consumable by other systems. That's why we'll be covering how to serve
models through a [REST](https://restfulapi.net/) endpoint or a Python package
with [MLEM](https://mlem.ai/).

> [here](https://github.com/iterative/stale-model-example/tree/mlem-serve).

## Take a candidate model

There are instructions in the project
[README](https://github.com/iterative/stale-model-example/tree/mlem-serve#readme)
on how to get everything you need installed and running. This is a simple ML
project that uses [DVC](https://dvc.org/) for data versioning and experiment
tracking.

After you have the repo set up, you'll already have the `mlem` package
installed. This project already has a model that's been trained and validated so
we can move on to saving this model.

## Save the model

Inside the `train.py` script, we need to add the `mlem` import to save the
models as we experiment. We don't have to worry about running the training
script for this project since we have the model, but it's good to know what's
happening under the hood.

```python
# train.py
import os
import pickle5 as pickle
import sys
import yaml

from mlem.api import save
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
...
```

Then you can add the `save` function to the end of the training script.

```python
# train.py
...
clf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=n_est, min_samples_split=min_split, n_jobs=2, random_state=seed
)

clf.fit(x, labels)

save(
    clf,
    "clf",
    sample_data=x,
    description="Random Forest Classifier",
)
```

<admon type="tip">

You don't have to do these steps as we already have a model available, but if
you want to see the training and evaluation steps in action, you reproduce the
DVC pipeline with:

```dvc
$ dvc repro
```

You can check out what is happening in that pipeline by looking at the
`dvc.yaml` file in the project.

You can also see where we load the model into the `src/evaluate.py` script. To
do that, you'll need to add the following import.

```python
# evaluate.py

...
import pickle5 as pickle
import sklearn.metrics as metrics
from mlem.api import apply
...
```

Now we can use the [`apply` function](https://mlem.ai/doc/api-reference/apply)
to make predictions with the model.

```python
# evaluate.py
...
x = matrix.iloc[:,1:11].values

cleaned_x = np.where(np.isnan(x), 0, x)
labels_pred = apply(model_file, cleaned_x, method="predict")

predictions_by_class = apply(model_file, cleaned_x, method="predict_proba")
predictions = predictions_by_class[:, 1]
...
```

The `predict` and `predict_proba` are methods available from the model and they
are used to get new predicted values and their probabilities for evaluation.
This, along with everything else in the script, is how we get the metrics for
each experiment.

After you run an experiment, there will be two new files in your repo: `clf` and
`clf.mlem`. Make sure you add the `clf.mlem` file to your Git history with the
following command:

```cli
$ git add clf.mlem
```

This is so that the metadata is in your repo and ready to use with other MLEM
commands. Now we can finally take the model file and ship it to production!

## Deploy the model to production

There are a couple of ways you can do this with MLEM:

- Serve the model with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
- Create a Python package (and use or distribute it).

_Note:_ There is an experimental option to
[deploy the model directly to Heroku](https://mlem.ai/doc/get-started/deploying)
although this functionality is experimental and may have breaking changes.

### Serve with FastAPI

If you don't have an API to work with and don't need a Python package, like if
you're just testing a model, you can serve your model quickly using FastAPI with
this command.

```cli
$ mlem serve clf fastapi
```

This will run a local server and spin up a web API for you so you can quickly
test out your model without needing a development team to work on the API
initially.

You'll see an output like this in your terminal:

```cli
$ mlem serve clf fastapi
‚è≥Ô∏è Loading model from clf.mlem
Starting fastapi server...
üíÖ Adding route for /predict
üíÖ Adding route for /predict_proba

INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Then, when you go to the local URL, you'll see the
[documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#automatic-docs) for how
to use the model you created.

That's it! Now you know how to train a model, save it, and deploy to some
external service quickly using MLEM!

### Custom Python package

Let's take a look at making a Python package and importing it into a
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) web app. To make the Python
package, we'll run the following MLEM command.

```cli
$ mlem build clf pip -c target=build/ -c package_name=bike_predictor
```

This takes our `clf.mlem` file and generates a Python package called
`bike_predictor` in the `build` directory. When you look in your project, you
should see that new `build` folder that has all of the files you need for an
independent Python package.

To build the package, you'll need to run the following command in the `build`
directory.

```cli
$ python -m build --wheel
```

Then go back to the top-level directory and run the following command to install
your new model package.

```cli
$ pip install ./build/dist/bike_predictor-0.0.0-py3-none-any.whln
```

Now you can import this to your Flask API like so.

```python
# api.py
import os
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from flask_cors import CORS
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import bike_predictor
...
```

You can then use the `predict` method on new data and run any other tasks you
need to in the API.

```python
# api.py
...
new_event = EventsModel(
    title=data["title"],
    date=data["date"],
    time=data["time"],
    location=data["location"],
    description=data["description"],
)

db.session.add(new_event)
db.session.commit()

bike_predictor.predict(new_event)
...
```

Then you can test this API out locally by running the following command:

```cli
$ python src/api.py
```

This will start up a local server on port 5000 and you'll be able to see your
model in action. From here, this can be deployed to any cloud environment as
long as you remember to include and install the model package.

## Conclusion

In this post, we learned how easy it can be to deploy a model through FastAPI or
through a Python package with MLEM. You can use this same process to train and
serve any model through an API endpoint very quickly. This can help with
validation, collaborating with team members, and it can help you see if there
are any underlying issues in your overall deployment process before you hear
about them from users. MLEM can also be used to create a model registry so you
can store and switch between models whenever you need to.
