Experiment tracking tools help manage machine learning projects where version
control tools like Git aren't enough. They log parameters and metrics, and they
store artifacts like input data or model weights, so that you can reproduce
experiments and retrieve results. They also provide a dashboard to navigate all
this meta-information across lots of experiments.

Git can't manage or compare all that experiment meta-information, but it is
still better for code. Tools like GitHub make distributed collaboration easy,
and you can see incremental code changes. That's why experiments get split
between Git for code and experiment tracking tools for meta-information (usually
with a link in one or the other to keep track).

ML experiment versioning combines experiment tracking and version control.
Instead of managing these separately, keep everything in one place and get the
benefits of both, like:

- **Experiments as code**: Track meta-information in the repository and version
  it like code.
- **Versioned reproducibility**: Save and restore experiment state, and track
  changes to only execute what's new.
- **Distributed experiments**: Organize locally and choose what to share,
  reusing your existing repo setup.

# ML Experiments as Code

Experiment versioning treats experiments as code. It saves all metrics,
hyperparameters, and artifact information in text files that can be versioned by
Git (DVC [data versioning](https://dvc.org/doc/start/data-and-model-versioning)
backs up the artifacts themselves anywhere). You do not need a centralized
database or online services. Git becomes a store for experiment
meta-information.

You can choose your own file formats and paths, which you can configure in DVC:

```dvc
$ dvc exp init -i
This command will guide you to set up a default stage in dvc.yaml.
See https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/project-structure/pipelines-files.

DVC assumes the following workspace structure:
├── data
├── metrics.json
├── models
├── params.yaml
├── plots
└── src

Command to execute: python src/train.py
Path to a code file/directory [src, n to omit]: src/train.py
Path to a data file/directory [data, n to omit]: data/images/
Path to a model file/directory [models, n to omit]:
Path to a parameters file [params.yaml, n to omit]:
Path to a metrics file [metrics.json, n to omit]:
Path to a plots file/directory [plots, n to omit]: logs.csv
```

Once you set up your repo in this structure, you start to see the benefits of
this approach. Experiment meta-information lives in readable files that are
always available, and your code can stay clean. You can read, save, and version
your meta-information:

```dvc
$ cat params.yaml
train:
  epochs: 10
model:
  conv_units: 128
```

```dvc
$ cat metrics.json
{"loss": 0.24310708045959473, "acc": 0.9182999730110168}
```

You can see what changed in parameters, code, or anything else:

```diff
$ git diff HEAD~1 -- params.yaml
diff --git a/params.yaml b/params.yaml
index baad571a2..57d098495 100644
--- a/params.yaml
+++ b/params.yaml
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 train:
   epochs: 10
-model:
-  conv_units: 16
+model:
+  conv_units: 128
```

With DVC, you can even compare lots of experiments from the terminal like you
would in a dashboard:

```dvctable
$ dvc exp show
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ neutral:**Experiment**              ┃ neutral:**Created**      ┃    metric:**loss** ┃    metric:**acc** ┃ param:**train.epochs** ┃ param:**model.conv_units** ┃

# Versioned reproducibility

One reason you need to track all this meta-information is to reproduce your
experiment. Experiment tracking databases save the artifacts, but you still need
to put them all back in the right place. Since experiment versioning keeps all
the meta-information in your repo, you can restore the experiment state exactly
as it was in your workspace. DVC
[saves the state of the experiment](https://dvc.org/blog/experiment-refs), and
it can restore it for you:

```dvc
$ dvc exp apply exp-333c9

Changes for experiment 'exp-333c9' have been applied to your current workspace.
```

Reproducibility is nice, but data drift, new business requirements, bug fixes,
etc. all mean running a slightly modified experiment. You don't have time to
always start from scratch. Versioned reproducibility means tracking changes to
the experiment state. DVC can determine what changes were introduced by the
experiment and only run what's necessary. It only saves those changes, so you
don't waste time or storage on duplicate copies of data.

```dvc
$ dvc exp run --set-param model.conv_units=128
'data/images.tar.gz.dvc' didn't change, skipping
Stage 'extract' didn't change, skipping
Running stage 'train':
> python3 src/train.py
79/79 [==============================] - 1s 14ms/step - loss: 0.2552 - acc: 0.9180
Updating lock file 'dvc.lock'

Reproduced experiment(s): exp-be916
Experiment results have been applied to your workspace.

To promote an experiment to a Git branch run:

        dvc exp branch <exp> <branch>
```

# Distributed Experiments

Experiment tracking tools log experiments to a central database and show them in
a dashboard. This makes it easy to share them with teammates and compare
experiments. However, it introduces a problem - in an active experimentation
phase, you may create hundreds of experiments. Team members may be overwhelmed,
and the tool loses one of its core purposes - sharing experiments between team
members.

Experiment versioning piggybacks on Git and its distributed nature. All the
experiments you run are stored in your local repo, and only the best experiments
are promoted to the central repo (GitHub for example) to share with teammates.
Distributed experiments are shared with the same people as your code repo, so
you don't need to replicate your project permissions or worry about security
risks.

With DVC, you can push experiments just like Git branches, giving you
flexibility to share whatever, whenever, and wherever you choose:

```dvc
$ dvc exp push origin exp-333c9
Pushed experiment 'exp-333c9'to Git remote 'origin'.
```

# What Next?

These enhancements can have powerful ripple effects for fast-moving, complex,
collaborative ML projects. There are parallels to the
[history of version control](https://ericsink.com/vcbe/html/history_of_version_control.html).
Git's distributed nature and incremental change tracking were major advances
over the centralized, file-based version control systems of previous
generations. Experiment versioning can similarly advance the next generation of
experiment tracking.

ML experiment versioning is still in its early days. Look out for future
announcements about:

- Deep learning features like [live monitoring](https://dvc.org/doc/dvclive) and
  [checkpointing](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/checkpoints).
- Visualizing and comparing experiment results in other tools like VS Code and
  [DVC Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/).
