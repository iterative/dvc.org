After a successful experience with the first edition of **Google Season of
Docs** [in 2019](/blog/dvc-project-ideas-for-google-summer-of-docs-2019), we're
putting out a call for writers to apply to work with DVC as part of the
[2020 edition](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). If you want to
write open source software documentation with mentorship from our team, read on.

**TLDR**: Skip to [project ideas](#project-ideas).

[DVC](https://dvc.org/) has a dedicated docs team and a
[well-defined process](/doc/user-guide/contributing/docs) for creating and
maintaining our documentation, modeled in part based on our past GSoD
experience. We are happy to share our experience, introduce technical writers to
the world of open source and machine learning best practices, and work together
on improving our documentation.

## Previous experience

In last year's Season, we matched with prolific writer
[Dashamir](https://github.com/dashohoxha), who helped us give proper structure
important part of our docs, and address key issues.

Some of our achievements together were:

- Reorganized our [tutorials](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/666) and
  core [contribution guide](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/726)
- Created [interactive lessons](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/546)
  on [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/dvc)
- Docs [cleanup](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/734)
- Suggested the creation of a
  [How To](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/563) section for our docs
- Other
  [contributions](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Adashohoxha)

Another collaborator we connected with via GSoD’19 was an amazing student
intern, [Aman](https://github.com/algomaster99). He helped us address
[dozens of tickets](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aalgomaster99+is%3Aclosed)
related to our Node.js docs web app. For example:

- Contributed to our
  [command reference](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/315) and
  [user guide](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/366), and created a
  much needed
  [documentation contribution](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/317)
  guide

- [Formatted](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/328) the source code of
  our docs and established an
  [automated mechanism](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/386) to
  enforce pretty formatting going forward

- Implemented super useful hovering tooltips based on a special
  [glossary](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/431):

  command reference_

### Community outreach

More positive results of the program included talks and meetups organized by our
open source contributors, with our mentorship:

![](/uploads/images/2020-04-30/SciPy_India_Aman.png) _Our intern Aman took a
several-hour long train ride to
[talk](https://static.fossee.in/scipy2019/SciPyTalks/SciPyIndia2019%5FS011%5FStoring%5Fa%5Ffew%5Fversions%5Fof%5Fa%5F5GB%5Ffile%5Fin%5Fa%5Fdata%5Fscience%5Fproject%5F20191130.mp4)
at [SciPy India 2019](https://scipy.in/2019)._

Another star contributor who found our project via GSoD,
[Kurian](https://github.com/kurianbenoy), closed
[several tickets](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+kurianbenoy),
produced a DVC intro tutorial in
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kurianbenoy/introduction-to-data-version-control-dvc)
and
[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O1XmUZ8Roj1dFxWTrpE55_A7lVkWfG04),
and ended up giving a talk in
[PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/machine-learning-model-and-dataset-versioning~dRqRb/):

He also covered DVC for the
[Devsprints](https://kurianbenoy.github.io/2019-11-03-Devsprints%5Fexperience/)
of [MEC.conf](https://enotice.vtools.ieee.org/public/50448)

https://twitter.com/FossMec/status/1192866498324254720

Yet another outstanding contributor,
[Nabanita](https://twitter.com/explorer_07), ended up organizing a DVC-themed
hackathon later that year:

## Prerequisites to apply

Besides the general requirements to apply to Google Season of Docs, there are a
few skills we look for in applicants.

1. **Clear English writing.** We strive express the concepts, processes, and
   details around DVC clearly, correctly, and completely. We use general and
   friendly wording as much as possible and pay close attention to consistency
   in our terminology. Our team will help with copy editing.

1. **Command line experience.** [DVC](/doc) is a command line tool that builds
   on top of [Git](https://git-scm.com/), so being able to play with it and test
   the features will be very useful. Creating and managing files, GNU/Linux
   commands, file and permission administration are desired skills.

1. **People skills.** We put a high value on communication: the ability to
   discuss ideas, explain your goals, report progress, and work kindly with more
   or less technical teammates.

If you like our mission but aren't sure if you're sufficiently prepared, please
be in touch anyway. We'd love to hear from you.

## Project ideas

Below are several project ideas that are an immediate priority for the DVC docs
team. We welcome technical writers to create their own proposals, even if they
differ from our ideas. Most projects will be mentored primarily by our lead
technical writer, [Jorge](https://github.com/jorgeorpinel).

1. **"How To" section.** Other than our
   [use cases](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases), we still lack a good place to
   answer common questions in our docs (think FAQ). We have compiled
   [set of topics](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/899) that we
   think would be best explained in a new **How To** section for this purpose.

   This project would imply relocating bits and pieces of info from existing
   docs into new how-tos, as well as writing significant new material to
   complete them. Expanding on our
   [troubleshooting](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/troubleshooting) page would
   probably go well as part of this project as well.

   _Difficulty rating:_ Beginner-Medium<br/><br/>

1. **DVC 1.0 docs.** We are soon to release DVC 1.0.0! This version brings some
   significant changes that for the first time in our
   [release history](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/releases) are not
   completely backward-compatible. We expect that fully updating all our
   previous docs will take a few months, and you could help us with this! The
   main new features are listed below.

   > UPDATE: See [post](https://dvc.org/blog/dvc-3-years-and-1-0-release) about
   > the release! And corresponding docs
   > [epic](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/1255) task

   - A
     [multi-stage _pipelines file_](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/1871)
     that partially substitutes
     [DVC files](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/dvc-files)
   - Separation between
     [scalar vs. continuous metrics](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/3409),
     and new commands to visualize them, such as `dvc plots`
   - A new [run cache](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/1234) that
     automatically saves experiment checkpoints between commits

   _Difficulty rating:_ Beginner-Medium<br/><br/>

1. **Video tutorials.** Written documentation is great, but other media can also
   be important for our organization to reach a wide variety of learners.
   Expanding to video is also a core part of our developer advocacy strategy.

   One of DVC's priorities for this year is creating a library of video
   tutorials ranging from short explanations of basic DVC functions to more
   advanced use cases. You could assist in writing the scripts or even take the
   lead producing some videos, so image/video editing skills would come in handy
   (optional).

   ![](/uploads/images/2020-04-30/Discord_user_video_tutorials.png) _Video
   tutorials are a common request by users in our [chat](https://dvc.org/chat)._

   **Mentor**: [Elle](https://github.com/elleobrien)

   _Difficulty rating:_ Beginner-Medium<br/><br/>

1. **Interactive guides.** Many of our docs include command line examples to
   illustrate how DVC works. In some cases these are full guides we want people
   to be able to follow by copying commands into their terminals. This has a few
   challenges: mainly keeping the rest of the document maintainable, brief, and
   easy to read; and supporting people on all platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux).

   So we started extracting some of the command examples into interactive
   [Katacoda scenarios](https://www.katacoda.com/dvc) to match certain docs,
   however they are in need of maintenance and completion, as well as being
   embedded into the corresponding pages per
   [this issue](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/670).

   This may involve working with our front-end team or, preferably, having some
   Javascript coding experience.

   _Difficulty rating:_ Medium-Advanced

1. **Javascript engine UI/UX.** Our website has custom
   [source code](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/tree/master/src) we've
   developed over the years to host our landing pages, docs, and blog all in a
   high-performance, advanced static site (Node.js, Gatsby, React, Typescript).
   We have several goals to further improve the usability and structure of our
   site, such as:

   - Creating a
     [special docs home page](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/1073)
   - Improving [mobile menus](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/808)
   - Better navigation sidebar
     [highlighting](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/753) and
     [positioning](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/1198)
   - Other
     [doc-engine](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adoc-engine)
     and
     [blog-engine](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ablog-engine)
     issues

   _Difficulty rating:_ Medium-Advanced<br/><br/>

1. **SEO/ Site Analytics.** Our current website analytics are somewhat basic. We
   will need to have a clear strategy to follow and improve our Search Engine
   results (with meta content, media optimization,
   [etc.](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+seo)),
   as well as to understand the behavior of our users to improve their
   experience. The specifics of the project are left for the applicant to
   suggest! This should be relatively simple for someone with proven experience
   in SEO or website QA.

   What tools should we employ? (e.g. Google Analytics, etc.) What trends and
   reports do we need to focus on? What kinds of users do we have and what
   interaction flows do they each follow? Can we semi-identify these users
   and/or cross-examine their data with DVC
   [usage analytics](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/analytics)? Let's come up
   with a plan to answer these and other related questions!
