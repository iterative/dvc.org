  Every month we share news, findings, interesting reads, community takeaways,
  and everything else along the way.

  Look here for updates about [DVC](https://dvc.org), our journey as a startup,
  projects by our users and big ideas about best practices in ML and data
  science.

Welcome to the March Heartbeat! Here are some highlights from our team and
community this past month:

## News

**DVC is STILL growing!** In February, Senior Software Engineer
[Guro Bokum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiojiajiu/) joined DVC. He's previously
contributed to the core DVC code base and brings several years of full-stack
engineering expertise to the team. Welcome, Guro!

**New feature alert.** We've received many requests for
[monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) support in DVC. As of DVC
[release 0.87.0](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/releases), users can version
data science projects within a monorepo! The new `dvc init --subdir`
functionality is designed to allow multiple DVC repositories within a single Git
repository. Don't forget to upgrade and
[check out the latest docs](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/init).

## From the community

First, there's an intriguing
[discussion evolving in the DVC repo](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/3393)
about how machine learning hyperparameters (such as learning rate, number of
layers in a deep neural network, etc.) can be tracked. Right now,
hyperparameters are tracked as source code (i.e., with Git). Could we use some
kind of abstraction to separate hyperparameters from source code in a
DVC-managed project? Read on and feel free to jump into this discussion, largely
helmed by software developer and DVC contributor
[Helge Munk Jacobsen](http://elgehelge.github.io/).

Another discussion we appreciated happened on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We give tools like Slack and Zoom a lot of credit for making remote work possible, and I think Git and every hosted DVC system should equally get the same credit. Imagine life for a second without version control. Think about that.</p>&mdash; Celestine (@cyberomin) <a href="https://twitter.com/cyberomin/status/1223651811082559488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Thanks, [@cyberomin](https://twitter.com/cyberomin)!

Elsewhere on the internet, DVC made the cut in a much-shared blog,
[Five Interesting Data Engineering Projects](https://medium.com/@squarecog/five-interesting-data-engineering-projects-48ffb9c9c501)
by [Dmitry Ryaboy](https://twitter.com/squarecog) (VP of Engineering at biotech
startup Zymergen, and formerly Twitter). Dmitry wrote:

One of the areas that DVC is growing into is continuous integration and
continuous deployment (CI/CD), a part of the nascent field of MLOps. Naturally,
we were thrilled to discover that CI/CD with DVC is taught in a new Packt book,
["Learn Python by Building Data Science Applications"](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/learn-python-by-building-data-science-applications)
by David Katz and Philipp Kats.

In the authors words, the goal of this book is to teach data scientists and
engineers "not only how to implement Python in data science projects, but also
how to maintain and design them to meet high programming standards." Needless to
say, we are considering starting a book club. Grab a copy here:

Last year in Mexico, DVC contributor Ramón Valles gave a talk about reproducible
machine learning workflows at Data Day Monterrey—and
[a video of his presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAxG-n20Di4) is
now online! In this Spanish-language talk, Ramón gives a thorough look at DVC,
particularly building pipelines for reproducible ML.

Finally, DVC data scientist Elle (that's me!) released a new public dataset of
posts from the Reddit forum
[r/AmItheAsshole](https://reddit.com/r/amitheasshole), and reported some
preliminary analyses. We're inviting anyone and everyone to play with the data,
make some hypotheses and share their findings. Check it out here:
