# From the Community

<span style="color:purple">**A**</span>s usual we have a ton of goodness from
the Community! Let's jump in!

## Antoine Toubhans' Post Combining Streamlit and DVC!

[Antoine Toubhans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-toubhans-92262119/) of
[Sicara](https://www.sicara.fr/) wrote a fantastic and detailed tutorial
entitled
[**How to Build Customizable Web UI for Machine Learning with Streamlit and DVC**](https://www.sicara.ai/blog/dvc-streamlit-webui-ml)
bringing together the best of DVC and integrating it with Streamlit to provide a
customizable UI. The tutorial <span style="color:purple">**g**</span>oes through
the steps of setting up a pipeline, spltting a dataset, training and evaluating
a model, tracking changes to data and model, dvc
<span style="color:purple">**m**</span>etrics and plots and then bridging the
gap in visualizations using <span style="color:purple">**S**</span>treamlit. You
won't want to miss this one!

Streamlit = ♥️!

## DVC and CML in Japanese!

For our friends that speak Japanese,
[these slides](https://www.slideshare.net/yusukeshibui/testing-machine-learningdevelopment)
created by
[Yusuke Shibui](https://www.slideshare.net/yusukeshibui?utm_campaign=profiletracking&utm_medium=sssite&utm_source=ssslideview)
walk you through a machine learning to production project using
D<span style="color:purple">**V**</span>C and
C<span style="color:purple">**M**</span>L. We love seeing our tools being used
all around the world! 🌏

## Miguel Méndez' DVC Tutorial

[Miguel Méndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-mendez/) and his team at
[Gradiant](https://www.gradiant.org/en/)
<span style="color:purple">**s**</span>truggled with reproducibility before
using DVC for versioning their image dataset and annotations. The dataset and
annotaions are held in a shared storage space and used by the whole team. DVC
enables the team to track changes and know what versions of the dataset produce
the best results. His tutorial walks you through the steps to set it up!

## Jobs requiring DVC!

We have been seeing an uptick in the number of jobs requiring knowledge of DVC.
It's exciting to see that our tools are
helpin<span style="color:purple">**g**</span> these companies in their MLOps
workflows! 🎉

# Learning Opportunities

With all those DVC job opportunities out there, you
<span style="color:purple">**b**</span>etter get on it! 😉

## A New Udacity Course Incorporating DVC!

Just this month a new
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821)
nannodegree program came out entitled
[**Machine Learning DevOps Engineer**](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821),
that teaches DVC as part of the program. This course includes sections on:

- Clean Code Principles
- Building a Reproducible <span style="color:purple">**M**</span>odel Workflow
- Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production
- Automated Model Scoring and Monitoring

## DVC Lea<span style="color:purple">**r**</span>n

This week we kicked off our new DVC Learn Meetup series with
[**Milecia McGregor**](https://twitter.com/FlippedCoding). This set of three,
short, half-hour classes are designed to get you up and running in DVC. If you
are just getting started with <span style="color:purple">**D**</span>VC or
kicking the tires, this Meetup series is for you! Our next class on August 4th
will get you started with experiments.

If you are interested in weighing in on what kinds of educational content you
would like to see from us, we'd be grateful if you'd fill out
[**this survey**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmwjs0ZkxDdODfZTvSwP2bVW4JAVVdxiYhQPyW5dSbsZC8qg/viewform?pli=1)
to help us plan! 🙏🏼

## Data Science Journal Article on Reproducibility Practices in Research

New research presented in the
[Data Science Journal](https://datascience.codata.org/) aims to provide best
practices for providing reproducibility in research datasets. This is necessary
to pinpoint the version of the dataset that grounds any research. In this work
the authors reviewed 39 use cases from 33 organizations to arrive at six
principles for versioning datasets. These include **Revision**, **Release**,
**Granularity**, **Manifestation**,
<span style="color:purple">**P**</span>**rovenance** and **Citation**. See the
full work below. 👇🏼

## June Office Hours Meetup

The June Office Hours Meetup was 🔥! Amazing discussion on experiments ignited
by [Sami Jawhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sami-jawhar-a58b9849/) of
[Kernel](https://www.kernel.com/) around experiment use cases and workflows.  
You can
[find the repo for his presentation here](https://github.com/sjawhar/dvc-cloud-runner)
and watch all the great DVC discussion below.

# DVC News

<span style="color:purple">**S**</span>ummer and vaccinations mean travel! ☀️💉
And that travel has enabled some of our team members to get together! Pictured
below are Dmitry Petrov, Alexander Guschin, Max Shmakov, Mikhail Rozhkov, Sergey
Kryukov, Mikhail Sveshnikov, and Guro Bokum... But not necessarily in that
order.

The first person to guess the correct order of our teammates starting from the
upper right of the picture moving clockwise, **and** post in the corresponding
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/DVCorg) Heartbeat post, will win some DVC SWAG!
Hint: If you've been wondering why there are random purple letters in this blog
post, they're a clue to this cipher. 🧐
