### The Future of AI Infrastructure is Becoming Modular: Why Best-of-Breed MLOps Solutions are Taking Off & Top Players to Watch

[**Casber Wang**](https://twitter.com/CasberW) of
[Sapphire VC](https://twitter.com/SapphireVC) recently wrote
[a piece in Medium](https://medium.com/sapphire-ventures-perspectives/the-future-of-ai-infrastructure-is-becoming-modular-why-best-of-breed-mlops-solutions-are-taking-fd85c6ca8bcf)
on the necessary trend of AI infrastructure tooling becoming modular. He notes
three types of AI user types, "Off-the-shelfers," "Bet-the-Farmers," and "Rocket
Scientists." As the industry matures he makes the case (and we concur) for the
need for modular infrastructure tooling to provide AI teams with the most
flexible approach as they fine-tune their advancing and ever-growing processes.

Wang describes the different toolchain groupings in the AI Lifecycle and
discusses some of the players in each of them. DVC shows up in the Model
Evaluation & Experiment Tracking group, but soon you will see that our tools
deliver flexible, modular building blocks for some other pieces of the puzzle.

## Data Distribution Shifts and Monitoring

[**Chip Huyen's**](https://twitter.com/chipro)
[most recent blog post](https://huyenchip.com/2022/02/07/data-distribution-shifts-and-monitoring.html)
created for the course at Stanford
[CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design](https://cs329s.stanford.edu/) goes
into detail on all things related to data distribution shifts and the monitoring
of them. The piece provides great examples to understand concepts such as
natural labels, the types of distribution shifts, causes of ML System failure,
and the metrics needed to monitor these things to determine when your model is
no longer producing the desired results. She discusses tools that can help
identify these shifts including logs, dashboards, and alerts, acknowledging the
pluses and minuses of each approach. Finally, the emergence of the favoring of
the term _observability_ over _monitoring_ is discussed because it is a stronger
concept for determining what went wrong with the internal states of a system by
observing the external outputs.

### MLOps is the Solution for Machine Learning and AI Projects

The team at [**xpresso.ai**](https://xpresso.ai) created
[this short post](https://xpresso.ai/resources/blogs/mlops-is-the-solution-for-machine-learning-and-ai-projects/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mlops-is-the-solution-for-machine-learning-and-ai-projects)
about all the facets that make up MLOps. While the tried and true
[CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining)
model for Data Science takes us right up to production, MLOps encompasses
considerably more processes that keep and maintain a model in production over
time. You can see all of these things highlighted in their image below,
providing lots to ponder!

### Yashaswi Nayak: Continuous Machine Learning - An Introduction to CML (Iterative.ai)

![Continuous Machine Learning - An Introduction to CML](/uploads/images/2022-04-15/yashaswi-nayak.png 'Continuous Machine Learning - An Introduction to CML :wrap-right ==300')
[**Yahaswi Nayak**](https://twitter.com/YashaswiNayak) writes
[a wonderful guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/continuous-machine-learning-e1ffb847b8da)
for data scientists and engineers, filled with great story-telling and fun
images created by the author about using [CML](https://cml.dev) to provide CI/CD
to ML projects. He discusses the usual software development cycle using Git and
then follows with the complexities introduced by ML projects. He identifies the
reasons why CML is needed in the ML space, and how CML works.

Yahaswi gives the scenario of a team working on a classifier problem and how CML
would work for different team members tackling different parts of the problem.
He details all the questions a CML.yml file answers and takes care of in the
workflow. Finally, he lists a number of use cases for readers to try out with
CML. We'd love to see some Community members write about some of these use cases
that they've put into action!

### Zoumana Keita: MLops — Data And Model Versioning With DVC and Azure Blob Storage

If you've ever struggled with setting up your Azure Blob Storage with DVC, or
you know you will need to in the near future, you're in luck!
[**Zoumana Keita**](https://twitter.com/zoumana_keita_) shows you how to do just
that
[in this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/large-data-versioning-with-dvc-and-azure-blob-storage-a-complete-guide-b97344827c81)
in [Towards Data Science.](https://towardsdatascience.com) He recently was
struggling with the same problem and team member,
[David de la Iglesia Castro](https://twitter.com/daviddelachurch) came to the
rescue on our [Discord Server.](https://discord.com/invite/dvwXA2N) Zoumana was
kind enough to write a blog article on the detailed steps for the benefit of the
Community.

At this point in this Heartbeat, you probably grasp the importance of data,
model, and experiment versioning and how DVC easily versions large files in
conjunction with Git, which Zoumana describes. But he then takes you on a
detailed journey with screenshots of all the steps to get DVC set up with Azure
Blob Storage. Many thanks for this tutorial! 🙏🏼
