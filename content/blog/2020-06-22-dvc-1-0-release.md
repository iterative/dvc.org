## Introduction

3 years ago, I was concerned about good engineering standards in data science:
data versioning, reproducibility, workflow automation like continuous
integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) but for machine learning. I wanted
there to be Git for data to make this possible. So I made DVC (Data Version
Control), which works as version control for data projects.

Technically, DVC codifies your data and machine learning pipelines as text
metafiles (with pointers to actual data in S3/GCP/Azure/SSH), while you use Git
for the actual versioning. DevOps folks call this approach GitOps or more
specificaly in this case - _DataOps_ or _MLOps_.

The new DVC 1.0. is inspired by discussions and contributions from our community
of data scientists, ML engineers, developers and software engineers.

## DVC 1.0

The new DVC 1.0. is inspired by discussions and contributions from our community

- both fresh ideas and bug reports 😅. All these contributions, big and small,
  have a collective impact on DVC's development- I'm confident 1.0 wouldn't be
  possible without our community. They tell us what features matter most, what
  approaches work and (and what don't!), and what they need from DVC to support
  their ML projects.

A few weeks ago we announced the 1.0 prerelease. After lots of helpful feedback
from brave users, it's time to go live. Now, DVC 1.0 is available with all the
standard installation methods including pip, conda, brew, choco, and
system-specific packages: deb, rpm, msi, pkg. See https://dvc.org/doc/install
for more details.

## New features

It took us 3 years to finalize the requirements for DVC 1.0 and stabilize the
commands (API) and DVC file formats. Below are the major lessons that we have
learned in 3 years of this journey and how the lessons are reflected to the new
DVC.

### [Multi-stage DVC files](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/1871)

Our users taught us that ML pipelines evolve much faster than data engineering
pipelines with data processing steps. People need to change the commands of the
pipeline often and it was not easy to do in the old DVC files.

In DVC 1.0 the DVC file format was changed in three big ways. First, instead of
multiple DVC stage files (`*.dvc`), each project has a single DVC file
`dvc.yaml`. By default, all stages go in this single .yaml file.

Second, we made clear connections between the `dvc run` command, where pipeline
stages are defined, and how stages appear in `dvc.yaml`. Many of the `dvc run`
options are mirrored in the metafile. We wanted to make it far less complicated
to edit an existing pipeline by making `dvc.yaml` more human readable and
writable.

Third, data hash values are no longer stored in the pipeline metafile. This
approach aligns better with GitOps paradigm and simplifies the usage of DVC
because tremendously improves human-readability of the `dvc.yaml`:

```yaml
stages:
  process:
    cmd: ./process_raw_data raw_data.log users.csv
    deps:
      - raw_data.log
    params:
      - process_file
      - click_threshold
    outs:
      - users.csv
  train:
    cmd: python train.py
    deps:
      - users.csv
    params:
      - epochs
      - log_file
      - dropout
    metrics:
      - logs.csv
      - summary.json
          cache: false
    outs:
      - model.pkl
```

All the hashes have been moved to a special file, `dvc.lock`, which is a lot
like the old dvc-file format. DVC uses the .lock file to define what data files
need to be restored to the workspace from data remotes (cloud storage) and if a
particular pipeline stage needs to be rerun. In other words, we're separating
the human-readable parts of the pipeline into`dvc.yaml` and auto-generated
"machine" parts into- `dvc.lock`.

Another cool change: the auto-generated part doesn't necessarily need to be
stored in your Git repository, the new feature run-cache that eliminates the
need of storing the lock file in Git repositories. That brings us to our next
big feature:

### [Run cache](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/1234)

We built DVC with a workflow in mind: one experiment to one commit. Some users
love it, but this approach gets clunky fast for others (like, folks who are
grid-searching hyperparameter space). Forcing users to make Git commits for each
ML experiment was a requirement for old DVC, if you wanted to snapshot your
project or pipelines on each experiment. Moving forward, we want to give users
more flexibility to decide how often they want to commit.

We had an insight that data remotes (S3, Azure Blob, SSH etc) can be used
instead of Git for storing the codified meta information, not only data. In DVC
1.0 a special structure is implemented - run-cache - that preserves the state in
cluding all the hashes. Basically, all the information that is stored in the new
`dvc.lock` file is replicated in the run cache.

The advantage of the run-cache is that pipeline runs (and output file versions)
are not directly connected to Git commits anymore. New DVC can store all the
runs in run-cache- even if they were never committed to Git.

This approach gives DVC a "long memory" of DVC stages runs. If a user runs a
command that was run before (Git committed or not), then DVC can return the
result of the command from the cache without rerunning it. It is a useful
feature for hyperparameter optimization stage when users return to the previous
sets of the parameters and don't want to wait for ML retraining.

Another benefit of the run-cache is related to CI/CD systems for ML which is a
holy grail of MLOps. The long memory means users don't have to make auto-commits
in their CI/CD system side - see
[this stackowerflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61245284/will-you-automate-git-commit-into-ci-cd-pipline-to-save-dvc-run-experiments).

### [Plots](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/3409)

Countless users have asked when we'd support metrics visualizations. It become
clear that metrics, metrics visualization is an essential part of _DataOps_
especially when it comes down to navigation around ML models, datasets and
experiments. Now it's here: DVC 1.0 introduces metrics file visualization
commands, `dvc plots diff` and `dvc plots show`. This is a brand new
functionality in DVC and it's _in experimentation mode_ now.

This function is designed not only for visualizing the current state of your
project, but it also for comparing plots across your Git history. Users can
visualize how, for example, their model accuracy in the latest commit differs
from another commit (or even multiple commits).

```dvc
$ dvc plots diff -d logs.csv HEAD HEAD^ d1e4d848 baseline_march
file:///Users/dmitry/src/plot/logs.csv.html
$ open logs.csv.html
```

![](/uploads/images/2020-05-04/dvc-plots.svg)

```dvc
$ dvc plots diff -d logs.csv HEAD HEAD^ d1e4d848 baseline_march \
        -x loss --template scatter
file:///Users/dmitry/src/plot/logs.csv.html
$ open logs.csv.html
```

![](/uploads/images/2020-05-04/dvc-plots-scatter.svg)

DVC plots are powered by the
[Vega-Lite graphic library](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). We picked Vega
because it's high-level to manipulate, compatible with all ML frameworks, and
looks great out of the box. However, you don't have to know Vega to use DVC
plots: we've provided default templates for line graphs, scatterplots, and
confusion matrices, so you can just point DVC plots to your metrics and go.

### [Data transfer optimizations](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/3488)

In _DataOps_, data transfer speed is huge. We've done substantial work to
optimize data management commands, like `dvc pull / push / status -c / gc -c`.
Now, based on the amount of data to move, DVC can choose the optimal strategy
for traversing your data remote.

[Mini-indexes](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/2147) help DVC instantly
check data directories instead of iterating over millions of files. This also
speeds adding/removing files to large directories.

More optimizations are included in the release based on performance bottlenecks
we profiled. More detailed
[benchmark report](https://gist.github.com/pmrowla/338d9645bd05df966f8aba8366cab308)
that shows how many second it takes to run a specific commands on 2M images
directory.

### [Hyperparameter tracking](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/3393)

This feature was actually released in the last DVC 0.93 version (see
[params docs](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/params). However, it is an
important step to support configuration files and ML experiments in a more
holistic way.

The parametes is a special type of dependencies in the pipelines. This is the
way of talling DVC that a command depends not on a file (`params.yaml`) but on a
particular set of values in the file:

```dvc
$ dvc run -d users.csv -o model.pkl \
        --params lr,train.epochs,train.layers \
        python train.py
```

The params.yaml is the place where the parameters are stored:

```yaml
lr: 0.0041

train:
  epochs: 70
  layers: 9

process:
  thresh: 0.98
  bow: 15000
```

### Stable releases cycles

Today many teams use DVC in their daily job for modeling and as part of their
production MLOps automation systems. Stability plays more and more important
role.

We've always prioritized agility and speed in our development process. There
have been weeks with two DVC releases! This approach had a ton of benefits in
terms of learning speed and fast feedback from users.

Now we're seeing signs that it's time to shift gears. Our API is stabilized and
version 1.0 is built with our long-term vision in mind. Our user base has grown
and we have footing with mature teams - teams that are using DVC in mission
critical systems. That's why we're intentionally going to spend more time on
release testing in the future - it might increase the time between releases, but
the quality of the tool will be more predictable.

Additionally, we've already implemented a benchmark testing framework to track
performance across potential releases: https://iterative.github.io/dvc-bench/ In
this web site, anyone can see the performance improvements and degradations for
every release candidate:
