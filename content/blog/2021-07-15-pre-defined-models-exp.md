## Intro

Trusting pre-trained models (because you lack the compute power & time) and just
replacing & fine-tuning the head is a common strategy in machine learning. In
fine-tuning, we start with a pretrained model and update all of the modelâ€™s
parameters for our new task, in essence retraining the whole model.

## Initialize the pretrained model

## Reshape the final layer(s) to have the same number of outputs as the number of classes in the new dataset

## Define for the optimization algorithm which parameters we want to update during training

## Run the training step

## Conclusion
