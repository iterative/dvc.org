This month we have been flooded with content from our Community. We are grateful
and inspired to keep serving you!

## Ricardo Manh√£es Savii: Trying to turn Machine Learning into value

If we can't turn machine learning into value, what good are we?
[**Ricardo Manh√£es Savii**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardoms/)
[wrote a piece in Medium](https://medium.com/@ricardosavii/trying-to-turn-machine-learning-into-value-de9f28cde056)
where he tackles how to technically and visually define the steps to deliver an
Intelligent System with the same level of best practice maturity that software
development has today. He combines and synthesizes the ideas of some of the best
known thinkers in the space to build a thorough architecture of machine learning
best practices. You won't want to miss this post and wrap your head around these
diagrams!

## RappiBank: How to build an efficient machine learning project workflow

Continuing the theme of ML workflow Complexity,
[**Daniel Baena**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/data-box-science/) wrote a
[great overview and tutorial piece](https://medium.com/rappibank/how-to-build-an-efficient-machine-learning-project-workflow-using-data-version-control-dvc-aaeaa9cfb79b)
outlining the challenges that his team at
[RappiBank](https://bank.rappi.com.br/) encountered and found ways to solve with
DVC including:

- confusing experiment files with different names
- disjointed messaging about training and models and dataset changes
- holding in your head or own notes progress that is not visible to the rest of
  the team
- heavy run and re-run times without a modularized system

Daniel shows how all of these things can be solved using DVC.üèÜ

## DAGsHub: Production Oriented Work

Next up, [**Nir Barazida**](https://twitter.com/barazida) from
[DAGsHub](https://dagshub.com/)
[created a video](https://dagshub.com/docs/workshops/production_oriented_work/?utm_content=bufferef4d6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
on Production-oriented work using a monorepo strategy and focusing on moving
from research to production-ready code using Git and DVC. If you are a data
scientist trying to wrap your head around going from your notebook to
production, this may help!

## ML Data Versioning with DVC: How to Manage Machine Learning Data

[**Piotr Storo≈ºenko**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotr-storo%C5%BCenko-438087128/)
of [Appsilon](https://appsilon.com/) wrote
[a great tutorial](https://appsilon.com/ml-data-versioning-with-dvc/) taking
into account the many challenges data scientists and ML engineers encounter in
their data versioning efforts and how DVC solves them. Do these scenarios from
his article look familiar?

> Was it in `model_3final.pth` or `model_last.pth` that I used a bigger lerning
> rate?
>
> When did I start using data preprocessing, during `model_2a.pth` or
> `model_2aa.pth`
>
> Is `model_7.pth` trained on the new dataset or on the old one?`
>
> Oh, gosh, which set of parameters and data have I used to train `model_2.pth`?
> It was pretty good in the end‚Ä¶‚Äù

# Learning Opportunities

## Raviraja Ganta's 10-week course on Basic MLOps

Twitter and LinkedIn were a blaze in the last month when
[**Raviraja Ganta**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravirajag/) announced his
[10-Week Course](https://www.ravirajag.dev/blog/mlops-summary) on MLOps basics.
This course is chock full of resoures and practical tutorials to build your
MLOps platform and knowledge. [Week 3](https://www.ravirajag.dev/blog/mlops-dvc)
of the course is about DVC and its ability to solve your versioning and
reproducibility challenges. Be sure to check out
[the course repo](https://github.com/graviraja/MLOps-Basics) as well!

[**MLOps Community**](https://mlops.community/) is hosting him to speak about
his course on October 20th.
[Sign up to attend here!](https://airtable.com/shrh5eGdEbcBsdEdq)

## Josh Willis video on COVID simulations with DVC

This week,
[this Tweet comment](https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/1441456258746249216)
led me to
[this work](https://mlconf.com/sessions/the-covid-scenario-pipeline-high-stakes-data-science/)
by [**Josh Wills.**](https://twitter.com/josh_wills) Josh was tapped by
[**DJ Patil**](https://twitter.com/dpatil) to participate in some COVID
simulation research early on in the pandemic in which he used DVC. In his
presentation about the project, he tells of the tools he used and challenges of
the use case. Nice DVC shout out at 19:56! Ah, the fruits of a Twitter üêáüï≥!

## September Office Hours Video: Transfer Learning with Milecia McGregor

If you missed last month's Office Hours
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DVC-Community-Virtual-Meetups/), you can now
catch the video! [**Milecia's**](https://twitter.com/FlippedCoding) presentation
was based on [her blog post](https://dvc.org/blog/transfer-learning-experiments)
on the same topic: Using Experiments for Transfer Learning. If you're curious
about transfer learning in general, AlexNet and SqueezeNet in particular, or
using DVC experiments and checkpoints to track all that you do, this video's for
you!

## Quoc-Tien Au: Continuously Learning on the Job as a Data Scientist

[This Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-what-where-and-how-about-continuously-learning-on-the-job-as-a-data-scientist-b0a31ea4ac48)
article by [**Quoc-Tien Au**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quoctienau/) entitled
"The What, Where, and How about continuously learning on the job as a data
scientist," speaks to some higher points on the need to have a mindset for
continuous learning in the Data Science field. It's packed with great thought
processes and resources on what to learn, where to learn, and how to keep
learning while still getting your work done. Who stuggles with this? üòÖ
