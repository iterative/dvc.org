  As machine learning matures, we need to find better ways to
  integrate data science with software development. In this talk
  for DivOps, a conference about the future of DevOps, DVC data
  scientist Elle O'Brien discusses how CI/CD can adapt to
  machine learning. This is MLOps, explained with fuzzy animals.

Last week, DVC was part of [DivOps](https://divops.org/), a fully remote
conference led by women in DevOps. DevOps, to the newly anointed, is a
discipline bringing together strong software engineering practices with speedy
development cycles. As machine learning is finding its way into just about
_every_ area of research and development, we're going to need to come up with
some conventions and tools for integrating machine learning and big data with
software development. This growing field is called
[MLOps](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-rise-of-the-term-mlops-3b14d5bd1bdb).

I gave a lightning talk about how we'll have to rethink our software development
practices in the age of machine learning. It's got a focus on
[CI/CD](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html), a way of structuring
workflows that we think can streamline exchanges between data scientists and
software engineers. And, it's got fuzzy animals. Check it out here:
