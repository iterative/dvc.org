## News

Happy February! Here's all the news to keep you up to date.

## We've hired and are still hiring!

We have four new team members this month!

[**Dave Berenbaum**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-berenbaum-20b6b424/) came
to Iterative.ai by way of a
[previous contribution](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/pull/2107) to our open
source products while working as a Data Science Manager at Captial One. He joins
the team as a Technical Product Manager. We are thrilled he's here!

[**Batuhan Taskaya**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/batuhan-osman-taskaya-7803b61a0/)
joins us as a DVC Software Engineer working on the Python core. Batuhan is
excited to work on open source full time and we are excited to have him do so!

[**Jeny De Figueiredo**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenifer-de-figueiredo/) is
involved in the Seattle area data science community at Data Circles and is a
WiDS Puget Sound Ambassador. She joins us as our new Community Manager and is
looking forward to further building and engaging the community in MLOps! (Hi!
This is me. 🙋🏻‍♀️ I'll be writing Heartbeat!)

[**Roger Parent**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogermparent/) has already been a
big part of building DVC and [CML](https://cml.dev/). He has been a primary
developer of a Visual Studio code extension that interfaces with the DVC Python
application to provide an interface with the Experiments feature that's coming
out with DVC 2.0. We are so excited to have him joining us full time as Software
Engineer.

## Open Positions

We are on the hunt for a
[TypeScript Front-End Engineer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aT5HZYt4kAUxXqD4JNTe3jPDlVUwSmnEWDPR2QoKdvo/edit)
to build SaaS and a VS Code UI for our popular machine learning tools: DVC and
CML. The ML tools ecosystem is what JS space was 10 years ago. Come join us on
this exciting project!

Our search continues for a
[Developer Advocate](https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/iterative-developer-advocate)
to support and inspire developers by creating new content like blogs, tutorials,
and videos - plus lead outreach through meetups and conferences.

Does this sound like you or someone you know? Be in touch!

## Iterative.ai Featured on The New Stack

[Susan Hall](https://thenewstack.io/author/susanhall/) of
[The New Stack.io](https://thenewstack.io/) interviewed our very own CEO,
[Dmitry Petrov](https://twitter.com/fullstackml), discussing the needs of ML
engineers and how Iterative.ai makes tools to enable version control and CI/CD
for versioning data and ML models.

> "ML engineers, they still need collaboration. They need GitHub for
> collaboration, they need this CI/CD system to resolve [issues] between each
> other, between the team and productions system." - Dmitry Petrov

## Workshops and Talks

### Developer Advocacy for Data Science

So you saw the post further up. 👆🏽 Curious about developer advocacy or what to
look for in a hire for this position?
[Elle O'Brien](https://twitter.com/drelleobrien) dove into this recently with
[Alexey Grigorev](https://twitter.com/Al_Grigor) (author of a
[Data Science Bookcamp](https://mlbookcamp.com/))
[in this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv5W4jXk4P4) on
[DataTalks.club](http://datatalks.club/) You can watch it here below. 👇🏼

## From the Community

As ever, we have much to share from the great citizens of the DVC community.

### spaCy and DVC Integration

If your NLP team uses spaCy to manage your projects, with spaCy's release of
v3.0, you can now enjoy DVC integration to manage your workflow like Git! Check
out the [documentation here](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#integrations) to
streamline and track your process! 🏆

### DagsHub and DVC Integrations

This month two great articles came out regarding the integration of DAGsHub and
DVC. First, this article:
[Datasets Should Behave Like Git Repositories](https://dagshub.com/blog/datasets-should-behave-like-git-repositories/)
walks you through the steps to use DVC in your data versioning. The following
image shows the dependencies and how you simply need to do a `dvc update` each
time your dataset or model changes to track the process.

### Did you say "Works Out of the Box?"

Also from DAGsHub, by CEO [Dean Pleban](https://twitter.com/DeanPlbn),
[Free Dataset & Model Hosting with Zero Configuration - Launching DAGsHub Storage](https://dagshub.com/blog/dagshub-storage-zero-configuration-dataset-model-hosting/)
tells how their new DAGsHub storage is a DVC remote that requires zero
configuration (!) and will allow for team and organization access controls as
well as easy visibility.

### Model Management and ML Workflow Orchestration with DVC and Apache Airflow 🇩🇪 ❗️

We're really excited about a German language workshop led by
[Matthias Niehoff](https://twitter.com/matthiasniehoff)! The workshop will be a
part of the ML Summit 2021 taking place April 19-21st, but registration closes
February 18th. So time is ticking. ⏰ The Conference is online, but will be in
German. For more info, head here 👉🏽 for the
[Workshop Details](https://ml-summit.de/machine-learing/modellmanagement-und-ml-workflow-orchestrierung-mit-dvc-und-apache-airflow/).

### "_The_ most popular 'N+1' tool used by teams on Spell"

[Using DVC as a Lightweight Feature Store on Spell](https://spell.ml/blog/using-dvc-with-spell-YBHOChEAACgAaSmV)
by [Aleksey Bilogur](https://twitter.com/ResidentMario) , reviews the process of
using DVC with Spell for managing changing datasets, enabling team-wide data
reproducibility and why Spell fans are DVC fans, and vice versa. 🔄
