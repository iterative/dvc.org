# From the Community

We've made it to the end of the year! 2021 has been an amazing journey for us
and our growing Community all over the world. There's lots of great news this
month. Let's not waste a heartbeat and get right to it! üòâ

![Heartbeat!](https://media.giphy.com/media/YAIOuXv2zYDW8/giphy.gif)

## DVC + CML + RASA = ‚ù§Ô∏è

[**Matthew Upson**](https://twitter.com/m_a_upson), Founder at
[MantisNLP,](https://mantisnlp.com/) an AI consultancy focused on NLP, along
with his team, put out the
[first blog post](https://medium.com/mantisnlp/mlops-for-conversational-ai-with-rasa-dvc-and-cml-part-i-beec756e8e7f)
in a series showing how to use DVC and CML along with Rasa in developing
conversational AI. This post sets the scene for the following more detailed
parts, but lays out DVC's use for generating the DAG as well as logging metrics
and using CML to do the testing. We're looking forward to the next installments!

## Curious about Speaker Diarization?

[The co-authored article entitled,](https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/speakerdiarization01)
‚ÄúWho Said That?‚Äù A Technical Intro to Speaker Diarization," by
[**Dario Cazzani**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dariocazzani/), and
[**Alex Huang**](https://github.com/alhuang10), machine learning engineers at
[Cisco,](https://www.cisco.com/) provides an introduction to the topic of
Speaker Diarization, or who spoke when, in audio recordings. Their team's
solution takes you through the fingerprinting of voices, clustering to assign
speaker labels, creating the needed data pipeline, and the integration with
Webex.

In this process, the team derives benefit from using DVC to version data and
models, as well as easily collaborate with each other and the transcription
team. More info on this project can be found
[in their repo.](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/vo-id#train-the-vectorizer)

## Using DVC in Academic Research on a Compartmental Infectious Disease Model

[**Matthew Segal**,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-segal-aa132093/)
[in his post,](https://mattsegal.dev/devops-academic-research.html) "DevOps in
Academic Research," reviews his work of applying some of the tried and true
practices in DevOps to data science projects using a
[Markov chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo)
(MCMC) technique to create a model to simulate the spread of tuberculosis and
later, as the pandemic erupted, COVID-19.

The article covers mapping the workflow (see below), testing the codebase, smoke
tests
[(with a guide link),](https://mattsegal.dev/pytest-on-github-actions.html)
contiunuous integration, and data management (where he recommends DVC).

## Are you confused by how many MLOps tools there are?

![Thoughtworks Trianglethoughtwork](/uploads/images/2021-12-15/thoughtworks-mlops-landscape.png 'Thoughtworks Platform vs. Specialist Triangle :wrap-right ==450')

Well
[Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/?utm_source=google-search&utm_medium=paid-media&utm_campaign=always-on-brand_2021-11&utm_term=thoughtworks&utm_content=RSAad1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2NaNBhDvARIsAEw55hg2li5srltu8ppVsxLzcnv-pYWRmvnCk_jmljiC2ocyM4tc7EUEt9gaAoVWEALw_wcB)
included DVC in its recent
[Thoughtworks Guide to MLOps Platforms](https://www.thoughtworks.com/what-we-do/data-and-ai/cd4ml/guide-to-evaluating-mlops-platforms).
While being included is great, things move so fast that they seemed to have
missed our experiment capabilities and the CI/CD capabilities for machine
learning of CML.ü§î

And if they only knew what's to come! üöÄ Lots planned in the new year!

![They don't know DVC has more tools coming](/uploads/images/2021-12-15/more-tools.png ' =800')

## What is MLOps - Everything You Must Know to Get Started

In his post,
[What is MLOps - Everything You Need to Know to Get Started,](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-mlops-everything-you-must-know-to-get-started-523f2d0b8bd8)
[**Harshit Tyagi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyagiharshit/) provides an
overview of MLOps and why it's necessary for today's ML and AI to production
projects. You will learn the different parts of the puzzle that make up MLOps,
and review the machine learning life cycle. In the post, Harshit also provides a
video of the concepts as well as an interview with our CEO,
[**Dmitry Petrov**.](https://twitter.com/FullStackML) Be sure to check it out!

## Using AntiPatterns to avoid MLOps Mistakes

[**Nikhil Maralidhar**,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilmuralidhar/) et. al.,
in their survey paper,
[Using AntiPatterns to avoid MLOps Mistakes,](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00079)
aim to develop a vocabulary for anti-patterns found in machine learning projects
in the financial services industry. In the paper, they also give recommendations
for acheiving MLOps at an enterprise scale using processes for documentation and
management. Luckily, our tools help you to solve some of these challenges!

You can also catch Nikhil's interview with
[**Ben Lorica**](https://twitter.com/bigdata) from
[The Data Exchange](https://thedataexchange.media/)
[podcast here.](https://thedataexchange.media/mlops-anti-patterns/)
