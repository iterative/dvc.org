## News

Welcome to the November Heartbeat! Let's dive in with some news from the team.

### DataCouncil interviews Dmitry

[Data Council](https://twitter.com/DataCouncilAI)'s
[Peter Soderling](https://twitter.com/petesoder?lang=en) interviewed CEO Dmitry!
Check out the recording from Data Council's live event, including Q&A from the
Data Council community, on YouTube.

### We're hiring

Did you know we're hiring for two roles in our growing team? We're looking for:

- A
  [**Senior Software Engineer**](https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/99244-remote-senior-software-engineer-iterative)
  for the core DVC team- someone with strong Python development skills who can
  build and ship essential DVC features.

- A
  [**Developer Advocate**](https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/iterative-developer-advocate)
  to lead the community, support contributors and new users, and create new
  content like blogs and videos about DVC and CML.

Here are a few reasons to consider joining us:

- Your work will be visible and will be used by thousands developers every day!
- We're a small, fully remote team. Work from anywhere!
- Competitive salary and benefits
- Family-friendly benefits, including unlimited PTO

If you're interested, we'd love to hear from you about either role (and we
welcome referrals if you know a good candidate)!

### New videos

We're continuing to develop our video docs, and now half of our "Getting
Started" section has video accompaniments. Check out our latest release on
[data access with DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/start/data-access):

https://youtu.be/EE7Gk84OZY8

This video covers functions like `dvc get`, `dvc import`, and the DVC Python
API.

We took a quick break from releasing videos during the US election week, but
look out for a new video on our
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC37rp97Go-xIX3aNFVHhXfQ)
about model testing with continuous integration! Subscribe to get alerts
whenever we have something new :)

### Workshops and conferences

As usual, there are plenty of remote meetings on our schedules:

- [HealthData Bootcamp](http://www.bootcamp.dadosesaude.com/) is a weeklong
  intensive for all things biomedical data science. Dmitry and myself (Elle),
  plus DVC Ambassadors Mikhail Rozhkov and Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas, will be
  presenting lectures and workshops about MLOps throughout the week!

- I'll be leading a hands-on workshop at the
  [Toronto Machine Learning Society Annual Meeting](https://torontomachinelearning.com/).
  It'll cover how to get started using
  [Continuous Machine Learning](https://cml.dev)(CML) with GitHub Actions-
  [register here](https://torontomachinelearning.com/join-us/), and be sure to
  reserve your spot in the workshop.

- This week, I have another talk at [PyData Global](https://global.pydata.org/)
  about CML. PyData Global is online for the first time ever and promises to be
  a great gathering for Python-using data scientists in industry and academic
  research alike.

## From the community

Here are some of our favorite happenings around the MLOps community this week.

### A new online course

[Goku Mohandas](https://twitter.com/GokuMohandas), founder of
[Made with ML](https://twitter.com/madewithml), announced plans to release a new
online course about putting ML in production. The curriculum will cover
everything from experiment tracking to deploying and monitoring models in
production, and you can expect DVC to be included! Keep an eye on Goku and Made
with ML on Twitter for updates.

### Our favorite blogs

[Dr. Larysa Visengeriyeva](https://twitter.com/visenger), creator of the
top-notch
["Awesome MLOps" GitHub repo](https://github.com/visenger/awesome-mlops), and
DevOps expert Anja Kammer wrote a must-read essay about CI/CD for ML (note: it's
published in German; I used Chrome's built-in translation to read in English).

The blog covers key concepts like continuous integration, deployment, and
training with ML, as well as practical approaches and sample architectures.

_Also_, there's some cool art.

Another blog on our radar: [Sean Lopp](https://twitter.com/lopp_sean) at
[RStudio](https://twitter.com/rstudio) made the first known blog about a CML
report with a ggplot! Using RStudio's
[GitHub Actions for R](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) and CML, Sean built a
sample data science workflow that runs automatically in GitHub Actions on a
push. He reports on some pros, cons, and areas for future development to make R
language data science easy to automate.

Finally, developer [Petr Stribny](https://twitter.com/stribny) wrote about how
to version big files in a Git project with DVC. It's a short-and-sweet guide to
getting started, and if you're trying to decide if DVC is for you, this is worth
a look.

### A nice tweet

To wrap it up, here's a kind tweet that we really like. It's always good to be
mentioned in the same tweet as some of our heroes :)
