### Introduction

A typical ML project lifecycle goes through three phases:

1. Active exploration or proof-of-concept phase. Here we try many different
   approaches to data preprocessing, model architectures, and hyperparameter
   tuning with the goal of finally settling on the most promising combination.
2. Application development phase. Here we build all the “plumbing” around the
   model, that is: getting input data, massaging it into the right format,
   passing it to the model, and, finally, serving the model's output. The goal
   here is to end up with a version of an end-to-end application that is robust
   and well-performing enough to be considered for deployment to the production
   environment.
3. Production deployment phase. Here we promote a well-tested version of the
   application from the development environment to the production environment.

In this series of posts we'll describe an approach that streamlines all three
phases. As our demo project, we've selected a very common deployment pattern in
CV projects: a CV model wrapped in a web API service. Automatic defect detection
is an example problem that we are addressing with this pattern. Specifically,
we'll perform an
[image segmentation](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/cvweb/tutorial3.html) task
on a magnetic tiles dataset first introduced in this
[paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Congying-Qiu/publication/327701995_Saliency_defect_detection_of_magnetic_tiles/links/5b9fd1bd45851574f7d25019/Saliency-defect-detection-of-magnetic-tiles.pdf)
and available in this GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/abin24/Magnetic-tile-defect-datasets.).

- This post (part 1) introduces the concepts of data versioning and ML pipelines
  as they apply to Computer Vision projects.
- Part 2 will focus on experiment tracking and management - key components
  needed for effective collaboration between team members.
- In part 3, you’ll learn how to easily move your model training workloads from
  a local machine to cloud infrastructure and set up proper CI/CD workflows for
  ML projects.

### Target Audience

We assume the target audience of this post to be technical folks (e.g. Software
Engineers, ML Engineers, Data Scientists) who are familiar with the general
Machine Learning and Computer Vision concepts, Python programming, CI/CD
processes, and Cloud infrastructure. Familiarity with the Iterative ecosystem of
tools such as [DVC](https://dvc.org/), [CML](https://cml.dev/), and
[Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/) is not required but would help with
understanding the nuances of our solution.

### Summary of the Solution

All the code for the project is stored in this GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect).

The CV API solution that we are proposing can be summarized in the following
steps:

- Client service will submit the image to our API endpoint
- The image will be preprocessed to adhere to the specifications that our model
  expects
- The CV model will ingest the processed image and output its prediction image
  mask
- Some postprocessing will be applied to the image mask
- A reply back to the client with the output mask

The repository also contains code for the web application itself, which can be
found in the
[`app`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/tree/main/app)
directory. While the web application is very simple, its implementation is
beyond the scope of this blog post. In short, we can say that it's based on the
[`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) library, and we deploy it to the
Heroku platform through a Docker container defined in this
[`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/Dockerfile).

### Prerequisites for Reproduction

Feel free to fork the
[repository](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect) if you'd like
to replicate our steps and deploy your own API service. Keep in mind that you'll
need to set up and configure the following:

- GitHub account and
  [GitHub application token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) installed locally
- AWS account,
  [access keys](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/),
  and an
  [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html)
- Heroku account and
  [Heroku API key](https://help.heroku.com/PBGP6IDE/how-should-i-generate-an-api-key-that-allows-me-to-use-the-heroku-platform-api)

For security reasons, you'll need to set up all keys and tokens through
[GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
You'll also need to change the remote location (and its name) in the
[DVC config](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/.dvc/config)
file for versioning data and other artifacts.

### Proof-of-Concept in Jupyter Notebooks

A typical ML project would start with data collection and/or labeling, but we
are skipping all this hard work because it was done for us by the researchers
who published the dataset.

We'll get right to the exciting part of training CV models in Jupyter notebooks
which you can find
[here](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/tree/main/notebooks).
In short, there we have three notebooks:

1. [`1_ProcessData.ipynb`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/notebooks/1_ProcessData.ipynb) -
   downloads, processes, and organizes the data for easy loading into the
   training process later
2. [`2_TrainSegmentationModel.ipynb`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/notebooks/2_TrainSegmentationModel.ipynb) -
   uses [`fastai`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) Deep Learning framework to
   train an image segmentation model
3. [`3_Evaluate.ipynb`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/notebooks/3_Evaluate.ipynb) -
   computes model performance on the test dataset

Jupyter Notebook is by far the most popular tool for quick exploratory work when
it comes to data analysis and modeling. However, it's not without
[its own limitations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U). One of the
biggest issues of Jupyter is that it has no guardrails to ensure
reproducibility, e.g. hidden states of variables and objects as well as the
possibility to run cells out of order. While there are several projects that
attempt to alleviate some of these issues (notably,
[`nodebook`](https://github.com/stitchfix/nodebook),
[`papermill`](https://github.com/nteract/papermill),
[`nbdime`](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime),
[`nbval`](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval),
[`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout), and
[`nbQA`](https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA)), they don’t solve them completely.

That's where the concepts of data versioning and ML pipelines come in.

### Data Versioning

Here, we'll briefly touch on DVC's functionality to version data and other
artifacts (e.g. model weights).

In most ML projects, training data changes gradually over time as new training
instances (images in our case) get added while older ones might be removed.
Simply creating snapshots of our training data at the time of training (e.g.
labeling data directories with dates) quickly becomes unsustainable since these
snapshots will contain many duplicates.

A much better approach is to:

1. track only the deltas between different versions of the datasets; and

2. have the project’s git repository store only the reference links to the data
   while the actual data is stored in a remote storage

This is exactly what we can do with DVC by running only a couple of DVC commands
and relying on DVC to handle all the underlying complexity:

- compute hashes of files (images in our case) and move them to the cache
- automatically manage reflinks to files stored in cache depending on the
  version of the dataset being used
- push and pull to different remote storage solutions using the same command
  syntax
- and, most importantly, integrate the process of data versioning with git-based
  workflows

Check out
[this tutorial](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files/tutorial)
to learn more about data and model versioning with DVC.

![Diagram of how DVC performs data versioning ](https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/86351git-dvc.png)

In this project, AWS S3 is our remote storage configured in the
[`.dvc/config`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/.dvc/config)
file. In other words, we store the images in an AWS bucket while only keeping
references to those files in our git repository.

### Refactoring Jupyter code into an ML pipeline

Another powerful set of DVC features is ML pipelines. An ML pipeline is a way to
codify and automate the workflow used to reproduce a machine learning model. A
pipeline consists of a sequence of stages.

First, we did some refactoring of our Jupyter code into individual and
self-contained modules:

- [`data_load.py`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/src/stages/data_load.py) -
  downloads raw data locally
- [`data_split.py`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/src/stages/data_split.py) -
  splits data into train and test subsets
- [`train.py`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/src/stages/train.py) -
  uses [`fastai`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) library to train a UNet
  model with a ResNet-34 encoder and saves it into a pickle file
- [`eval.py`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/src/stages/eval.py) -
  evaluates the model's performance on the test subset

Specific execution commands, dependencies, and outputs of each stage are defined
in the pipeline file
[`dvc.yaml`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/dvc.yaml)
(more about pipelines files
[here](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/project-structure/pipelines-files)).

We've also added an optional
[`check_packages`](https://github.com/iterative/magnetic-tiles-defect/blob/main/dvc.yaml#L2)
stage that freezes the environment into a `requirements.txt` file containing all
python packages and their versions installed in the environment. We enabled the
[`always_changed`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/run#--always-changed)
field in the configuration of this stage to ensure DVC reruns this stage every
time. All other stages have this text file as a dependency. Thus, the entire
pipeline will be rerun if anything about our python environment changes.

We can see the whole dependency graph (directed acyclic graph, to be exact)
using the [`dvc dag`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/dag) command:

```bash
$ dvc dag

                                  +----------+
```

The entire pipeline can be easily reproduced with the `dvc exp run` command:

```bash
$ dvc exp run
Running stage 'check_packages':
> python src/stages/check_pkgs.py --config=params.yaml
...
Running stage 'data_load':
> python src/stages/data_load.py --config=params.yaml
...
Running stage 'data_split':
> python src/stages/data_split.py --config=params.yaml
...
Running stage 'train':
> python src/stages/train.py --config=params.yaml
...
Running stage 'evaluate':
> python src/stages/eval.py --config=params.yaml
...
```

## Summary

In this first part of the blog post, we talked about the following:

- Common difficulties when building Computer Vision Web API for defect detection
- Pros and cons of exploratory work in Jupyter Notebooks
- Versioning data in remote storage with DVC
- Moving and refactoring the code from Jupyter Notebooks into DVC pipeline
  stages

In the second part, we’ll see how to get the most out of experiment tracking and
management by seamlessly integrating [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc),
[DVCLive](https://github.com/iterative/dvclive), and
[Iterative Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai/).
