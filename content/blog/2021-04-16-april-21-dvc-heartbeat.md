## From the Community

We're starting with the community this month because it has been overflowing
with great content from our users. It's like we're on a sugar high!

### Goku Mohandas' New Lessons!

First up, [Goku Mahandas](https://twitter.com/GokuMohandas) of
[Made With ML](https://madewithml.com/) has added this
[Versioning Lesson](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/versioning/) to the
popular **MLOps Course** using DVC.  
It's RT'ing around the MLOps Twitter space like hotcakes! 🥞

### Ryzal Kamis Tutorial

[**Ryzal Kamis**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryzalkamis/) of
[AI Singapore](https://twitter.com/AISingapore) has created an
[**in depth tutorial**](https://makerspace.aisingapore.org/2021/04/data-versioning-for-cd4ml-part-2/)
on data versioning using DVC. This is a follow up article to his
[tutorial that was featured in the September Heartbeat.](https://dvc.org/blog/september-20-dvc-heartbeat)
Thanks Ryzal for this detailed work! 🙏🏼

## DVC used to help in Research published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences 🧑🏻‍🔬

[Anton Kulaga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonkulaga/) and his team used DVC
pipeline tracking in their research that selects genes connected with maximum
lifespan in mammals. You can check out the
[paper here](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/3/1073) as well as their
[pipeline use case here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kI1f62z0Opt8KD4Mf1yrYKftYLOZel3EjbfjDJiQQzg/edit)
and their [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/antonkulaga/yspecies)

See the diagram of the research below.👇🏼

## DAGsHub ❤️ DVC Colab Notebook

The DevRel team at [DAGsHub](https://dagshub.com/) made
[this cool notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JJIwAH0TBSY49um5s2FD0GEA6bw3SKrd#scrollTo=cjbAYZDfB3JB)
that trains a model to classify email as either 'Ham' or 'Spam.' The notebook
shows how to integrate DAGsHub remote storage with DVC to track code and data
files.

## And we keep on growing our worldwide team! 🌏

We are getting to the point where our new hires could take up our whole
Heartbeat! 😅🚀💗

[**Julie Galvan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianna-galvan/) joins our team
from Houston, Texas as an engineer. She is focused on web development. In her
free time Julie loves reading, especially fantasy fiction (Harry Potter #6 was
fav) and paper crafting. Welcome Julie!🎉

Under as a DVC front-end engineer! 🦘 He lives in Kiama, a small town on the
East Coast of Australia. Originally from Scotland, when he's not programming he
likes to spend time with his family away from screens (😅🙌🏼) and he volunteers
for the state emergency service. 🤲🏼

[**Yanxiang Gao**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaoyanxiang/) (who graciously
allows us to call him Gao) joins us from Hangzhou, China as new DVC engineer.
Gao has a Masters in Physics and has previously worked as a Machine Learning
engineer in Chinese tech companies using DVC. He has been a long time
contributor to DVC and we are so glad to have him on the team now!🎉

[**Daniel Kharitonov**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielkharitonov/) joins us
from Stanford, California as a Technical Product Manager Intern. Daniel

image augmentation with GANs, and synth data generation for autonomous vehicles.
Welcome to the team Daniel! 🙌🏼

Last but not least joining just this week,
[**Milecia McGregor**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milecia/) joins us as a
Developer Advocate from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Milecia has a background in mechanical
and aerospace engineering, some machine learning on autonomous vehicles, and
basically everything that the web touches. She also practices kung fu in her
free time.🥋🙇🏻‍♀️ We think that's "Oklahoma, OK!" 👌🏼
