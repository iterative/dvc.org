This month‚Äôs image inspiration is community member
[**Sami Jawhar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sami-jawhar-a58b9849/). Sami has
contributed to DVC in the past and most recently to the DVC and CML teams with
regard to extending our remote experimenting features to include running
experiments in parallel, which you can check out
[here](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/commit/c7d63e8c59819592d2a749ab721fe5c85379fece)
and
[here]([https://github.com/iterative/terraform-provider-iterative/compare/master...sjawhar:terraform-provider-iterative:feature/nfs-volume](https://github.com/iterative/terraform-provider-iterative/compare/master...sjawhar:terraform-provider-iterative:feature/nfs-volume).
Look out for him speaking at a Meetup soon on this topic!

Last year Sami presented at one of our
[Office Hours meetups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxZdWq3Weng) on ‚ÄúWhat is
an experiment?‚Äù More specifically he asked, at what level of granularity do you
experiment and when do you share with your team? He shared great ideas, tips,
and code in the session and spurred a great discussion with other community
members. We look forward to the next Meetup!

## From Greater AI/ML Community

### Meta Is Building an AI to Fact-Check Wikipedia‚ÄîAll 6.5 Million Articles

![Meta Fact-Checking Wikipedia](../uploads/images/2022-09-19/wikipedia.png 'Meta Fact-checking Wikipedia Ai :wrap-left =300')
[**Vanessa Bates Ramirez**](http://twitter.com/vanessabramirez) writes
[an article](https://singularityhub.com/2022/08/26/meta-is-building-an-ai-to-fact-check-wikipedia-all-6-5-million-articles/)
in [Singularity Hub](https://singularityhub.com) about Meta's plans to
fact-check Wikipedia. Under the premise of making Wikipedia more accurate,
[Meta](https://about.facebook.com/?utm_source=meta.com&utm_medium=redirect), in
conjunction with [Amazon Alexa.AI](https://www.amazon.science/tag/alexa) and
[some University contributors](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qfTqRtkDbWZ) is
building an AI system trained on 4 million Wikipedia citations. The system
architecture made up of retrieval and verification engines, cross references not
only content, but specific figures to verify accuracy.

They‚Äôve built an index of web pages that are chunked into passages and then
provide an accurate representation of the passage to train the model. Their aim
is to more accurately capture meaning as opposed to word pattern. From
[**Fabio Petroni**](https://twitter.com/Fabio_Petroni), Meta‚Äôs Fundamental AI
Research tech lead manager:

> [This index] is not representing word-by-word the passage, but the meaning of
> the passage. That means that two chunks of text with similar meaning will be
> represented in a very close position in the resulting n-dimensional space
> where all these passages are stored.

They hope to ultimately be able to suggest accurate sources and create a grading
system on accuracy.
[You can find a demo of the project, named Side, here](https://verifier.sideeditor.com/)
to look at samples and go deeper into the research. They are looking for people
to give feedback on the quality of the system.

Vanessa brings up some great questions regarding this:

> If you imagine a not-too-distant future where everything you read on Wikipedia
> is accurate and reliable, wouldn‚Äôt that make doing any sort of research a bit
> too easy? There‚Äôs something valuable about checking and comparing various
> sources ourselves, is there not? It was a big leap to go from paging through
> heavy books to typing a few words into a search engine and hitting ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù; do
> we really want Wikipedia to move from a research jumping-off point to a
> gets-the-last-word source?

To these I‚Äôd add, what‚Äôs Meta‚Äôs/Amazon Alexa's monetary motivation to do this
(because there always is one), and given past ethical infractions on Meta's part
( [1,](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-021-00068-x)
[2,](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/facebook-whistleblower-says-instagram-content-hurts-teens/13573020)

and
[5,](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/))
should we applaud this? Or is this collaboration with Universities a step in the
right direction?

### European AI Act

![EU AI Act](../uploads/images/2022-09-19/eu.jpg 'EU AI Act :wrap-rightt =300')
[**Kyle Wiggers**](https://twitter.com/Kyle_L_Wiggers) reports on the EU's AI
Act and its potential ill effects on open source efforts in
[this piece](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/06/the-eus-ai-act-could-have-a-chilling-effect-on-open-source-efforts-experts-warn/)
in [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com). The proposed new rules would require
that open source developers adhere to guidelines across a spectrum of categories
including risk management, data governance, technical documentation and
transparency, standards and accuracy, and cyber security. Not a negligible list.

The article covers critiques of the Act from
[**Alex Engler**](https://www.brookings.edu/experts/alex-engler/) of think tank
[Brookings](https://brookings.edu) through
[this piece.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2022/08/24/the-eus-attempt-to-regulate-open-source-ai-is-counterproductive/)
While [**Oren Etzioni**](https://twitter.com/etzioni), the founding CEO of the
[Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) adds that such regulation could
create an undue burden where only large tech companies could comply:

> ‚ÄúOpen source developers should not be subject to the same burden as those
> developing commercial software. It should always be the case that free
> software can be provided ‚Äòas is‚Äô ‚Äî consider the case of a single student
> developing an AI capability; they cannot afford to comply with EU regulations
> and may be forced not to distribute their software, thereby having a chilling
> effect on academic progress and on reproducibility of scientific results.‚Äù

The article discusses some proponents to the Act, as well as alternative thought
processes on the granularity of regulations (product vs. category, or downstream
responsibility). Finally, it ends with some thoughts from Hugging Face CEO,
[**Cl√©ment Delangue**](https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue) and his colleagues'
comments on the vagueness and the problems that can arise out of this lack of
clarity, including stifling competition and innovation. They also point out the
growing Responsible AI initiatives such as AI licensing and model cards
outlining the intended use of such open source technology as positives that are
community-born.

So does regulation stifle technology or provide guard rails?

My colleague [**Rob de Wit**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcdewit/) would like
to point out that similar concerns were raised when the EU introduced the GDPR
in 2016, which has turned out to be of major importance to people's rights to
privacy -- in the EU and worldwide.

To what degree should AI technology be regulated? Where do you draw lines? It‚Äôs
quite clear that it moves faster than lawmakers can keep up with and the
potential for harm is well known at this point. We could say, as I believe, that
reflection on the consequences should be baked into the building process.
However, the reality in practice is that --despite best intentions-- the
overarching push for better and faster often results in negative consequences
that are only discovered after the fact.

How do we incentivize reflecting on consequences in our processes? Would
regulation force this? Make development slower, but necessarily force the social
good work that must be done in the development of AI tech?

What other industries have similar dilemmas and how do they handle it? The
Hippocratic Oath has served medicine well for thousands of years.

## Iterative Community News

### **Francesco Calcavecchia** - We refused to use a hammer on a screw: Story of GTO-based model registry

[**Francesco Calcavecchia**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescocalcavecchia/)
[wrote a piece](https://medium.com/@francesco.calcavecchia/we-refused-to-use-a-hammer-on-a-screw-story-of-a-gto-based-model-registry-c540ac5d129f)
in [Medium](https://medium.com) about building a custom model registry with
[GTO](https://github.com/iterative/gto).

He acknowledges the main reasons for needing a model registry as:

1. When you need model versioning
2. When you need to promote or assign models to different stages
3. When you need to establish production model governance

Additionally, he finds registering the data analysis and model evaluation
outputs into an artifact registry is necessary, and as such used GTO and DVC to
accomplish this. He goes into more detail about why he chose GTO over MLFlow -
essentially appreciating our UNIX philosophy that empowers agility over
prescriptive methods that hamper your design choices. He notes:

> **It is hard to think of something simpler than this. And simplicity is
> beauty**¬†‚ù§Ô∏è

He then discusses some things he found missing for his needs, such as using it
in a production pipeline as opposed to committing models by hand. He discusses
working on solutions to build the artifact registry, introduce new commands, and
streamline the process for the `dvc push` remote storage secret requirements.
Please join him in his contributions. We love to see where this is going! üöÄ

### MLOps Course at the Technical University of Denmark includes DVC and CML

![DTU MLOps Course Memes](../uploads/images/2022-09-19/dtu-mlops.jpeg 'DTU MLOps Course Meme :wrap-left =300')
The [Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](https://www.dtu.dk/english) has
included DVC and CML in its MLOps Course at the University. The lectures,
slides, exercises, and code can be found in
[this repo](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/dtu_mlops) from
[**Nicki Skafte Detlefsen**](https://github.com/SkafteNicki), Postdoc in the
section of Cognitive Systems at the University with a focus on generative models
and geometrical deep learning. There are 10 sections covering:

1. Getting started
2. Organization and version control (find Git and DVC here)
3. Reproducibility
4. Debugging and logging
5. Continuous X (find CML here)
6. The Cloud
7. Scalable applications
8. Deployment
9. Monitoring
10. Extra Resources

The materials are great and even include some funny memes. Isn't an open-source
model amazing for learning? Cheers to DTU for including our tools and the open
source sharing of these learning materials with the world!

### **Goku Mohandas** - Made With ML MLOps Interactive Course

You likely already know of [**Goku Mohandas'**](https://github.com/GokuMohandas)
wildly popular free course [Made with ML](https://madewithml.com/#mlops), which
includes DVC. Knowing that it can be challenging to learn everything on your
own, he is starting an interactive class beginning on October 1st. The deadline
for application is September 25th.

### **Adri√† Romero** - YouTube review of DVC

[**Adri√† Romero**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriaromero/), Computer Vision
Developer at [Lakera](https://www.lakera.ai/), has a regular tool review on
tools that can make computer vision easier, and recently reviewed DVC. He does a
demo of DVC pushing up to a Google Drive remote and goes over how to share
DVC-tracked data. He then covers the data pipelines functionality that can be
used for CI/CD pipelines and shows the benefits of tracking the versions of
everything including data, models, pipelines, parameters, and experiments.
Finally, he mentioned that our documentation is super clear and useful, which
makes us very happy. ü¶âCheck out the review below.

### **Sydney Firmin** - Reproducibility, Replicability, and Data Science

![Sydney Firmin - Reproducibility, Replicability, and Data Science](../uploads/images/2022-09-19/the_difference.png ' :wrap-right =300')

[**Sydney Firmin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sydney-f-4369a65b/) writes
[a wonderful piece](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/11/reproducibility-replicability-data-science.html)
in KD Nuggets outlining the replicability crisis, the importance of
reproducibility in science in general and data science in particular. She
highlights the growing awareness of irreproducible research due to technology's
help to make all research better circulated. She encourages standardizing a
paradigm of reproducibility in data science work to promote efficiency,
accuracy, and to help your future self and colleagues check work and reduce
bugs.

Of course, she recommends DVC as a possible tool to help with this and notes,

> fun fact, this is my second attempt at writing this post after my computer was
> [bricked](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)>) last week. I am
> now compulsively saving all of my work
> in¬†[the cloud](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/11562024/too-embarrassed-to-ask-what-is-the-cloud-and-how-does-it-work).

Haven‚Äôt we all been there? üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†She goes on to describe other contributors to
irreproducible results including p-hacking and discusses other methods in
addition to tooling that can help, such as preventing overfitting and using a
sufficiently large dataset, and team review. All this and some fun xkcd comics
can be found in the post including [this one shown above](https://xkcd.com/242)!

<details>

Speaking of xkcd comics,
[**Casper da Costa Luis**](https://github.com/casperdcl), CML Product Manger,
loves xkcd and regularly regales us with the comics in our internal Slack. He is
also an expert at TL;DRing (yes, I just made that a verb). Part of his process
in this excellence is to
‚Äú[suppress my latent desire to add a relevant xkcd comic](https://tldr.cdcl.ml).‚Äù
As you can see, they do not appear every day. Self-discipline is a good thing.

### MLEM, MLEM, MLEM, this dog food is good!

So over the summer, you may have noticed that our blog has moved from the
[DVC](https://dvc.org) website to the [Iterative](https://iterative.ai) website.
This is because as we now have many more tools than DVC, we wanted to make a
blog home for them all. In this transition, we have also changed our internal
blog writing process from being just Git-dependent to Git- and DVC- dependent,
such that the writing is in Git, but the images are versioned with DVC and
stored in a remote. ü§ó

This admittedly may be like bringing a
[CNC router](https://arclightcnc.com/product/cnc-router-kit) to a steak dinner
(I feel like there should be a Myth Busters episode on this). **But** it will
help both the DevRel team and the Websites team become intimately familiar with
what our users feel when using our tools and potentially drive more feature
improvements for you. In other words, we ‚ù§Ô∏è you and we're really serious about
making our tools better for you so you don't have to build them yourselves!

### New Hires

[**Ronan Lamy**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronan-lamy-84133612/) joins the DVC
team from Bristol, UK. He has a Ph.D. in physics and had been working as an
open-source contractor as core dev of PyPy and HPy before joining Iterative.
When he's not working Ronan enjoys exploring the many fine restaurants and great
local beers of Bristol. Originally from France, Ronan recently shared with me
that his friends and family back home don't believe that the food can be so good
in Bristol, but he insists it is. Add it to your bucket list! When in Bristol,
Ronan has recommendations for you!

[**Aleksei Shaikhaleev**](https://github.com/nimdraugsael) joins the Studio team
as a backend developer. Originally from Russia, Aleksei has called Phuket,
Thailand his home base for the last 10 years. When he's not working, he's really
into surfing, skateboarding, motorcycles, and other fun activities like these.
Aleksei also has a heart for rescuing cats, having adopted and caring for five
stray cats at home!

[**David Tulga**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-tulga-60b29410/) is our
latest hire, and joins the LDB team from California as a Senior Software
Engineer. He previously worked at Asimov and Freenome. When not working David
enjoys a variety of outdoor activities such as Biking, Hiking, Kayaking,
Sailing, and Astronomy.

David's arrival marks the 4th David on the team, putting the name David in a
three-way tie with versions of Daniel and Alexander! Indeed over 20% of our
workforce is named David, Daniel, or Alexander. üòÖ
