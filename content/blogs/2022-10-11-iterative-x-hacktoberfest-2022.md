Hacktoberfest is DigitalOcean’s annual event that encourages people to
contribute to open source throughout October. Hacktoberfest is all about giving
back to the community by contributing to open-source projects. The main point of
Hacktoberfest is encouraging new open-source contributors whether you’re a
seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first
time, you’re welcome to participate!

## What is Iterative

Iterative is a remote-first team on a mission to solve the complexity of
managing datasets, ML Infrastructure, and ML model lifecycle management. It was
started in 2018 by a data scientist and an engineer to fill in the gaps in the
machine learning to production. Presently Iterative is growing pretty fast,
adoption of the Iterative tools has significantly increased, and we have our
contributors to thank (more than 300 in both code and docs) for developing open
source projects such as DVC, CML, and MLEM with us.

your efforts and collaborate with you positively, sharing feedback and
expressing gratitude.

time; you have 4 weeks left to submit PRs and get your swag! Here are some
important details:

At Iterative our mission is to deliver the best developer experience for machine
learning teams by creating an ecosystem of open, modular ML tools. Our tools are
built for developers, by developers and we need help from the global -
open-source community - to deliver this mission!

For all of us who have a heart for open source — let’s discuss, contribute,
learn, take the technologies forward and build something great together!

Happy hacking!
