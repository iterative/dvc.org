## Andrew Ng at Intel's Innovation Conference - Democratizing AI through Data-Centric AI

https://youtu.be/G3MaIMrR6Ms

At
[Intel‚Äôs Innovation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/events/on-event-series/innovation.html)
conference, [**Andrew Ng**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/) gave a
keynote on democratizing AI. He posits that while large companies have embraced
AI, most smaller companies outside of the consumer-based domains still struggle.
He provides two main reasons for this: small datasets and customization.

According to Ng, data-centric AI will be the key to unlocking that potential,
forcing a paradigm shift away from code-centric AI. In this scenario, people
could take mostly ready-built ML tech and focus on the data to ensure it
captures all necessary domain knowledge.

For example, two companies that produce cornflakes and medication could take the
same ML model and train it on their respective datasets. As long as they have
the right tools and practices and provide a domain representative dataset, the
same model can reproduce effective results. If you want to see some of the tools
Ng uses, make sure to check out his keynote.

What do you think? Does the average data scientist need a different set of
skills in the near future? Are you in one of these smaller industries that are
starting to embrace AI? We'd love to read your thoughts! Join us in our
[discussion of this topic on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dvwXA2N)!

## Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights

![Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights](../uploads/images/2022-10-20/blue-print.png 'White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights :wrap-left =300')
If you will recall from
[last month's Heartbeat](https://iterative.ai/blog/september-22-heartbeat#european-ai-act)
we called to your attention the EU AI Act. This act proposes new rules that
would require that open source developers adhere to guidelines across a spectrum
of categories including risk management, data governance, technical
documentation and transparency, standards and accuracy, and cyber security. Not
to be outdone, the US White House declared a
[Blue Print for an AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/).
[The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/)
has defined 5 categories for these rights:

1. Safe and Effective Systems
2. Algorithmic Discrimination Protection
3. Data Privacy
4. Notice and Explanation
5. Human Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback

There's definitely some overlap here with the EU AI Act and some catching up
with Data Privacy in the mix. There's lots to unpack, compare, and contrast on
scope and philosophy between the two. It's nice to see that major attention is
given to these issues.

We could think of the relationship between AI rights and Andrew Ng's talk in the
sense of the AI space maturing. To Andrew Ng's points, as we move from the
frenzied all-important model development to an understanding of the need for a
data-centric approach and this democratization, we are changing the focus to
enable us to adequately address these hard and important issues. Improving the
efficiency of tooling will help with this too. That's why we are here.

What do you think? Do the efficiencies we are gaining open up room for improved
time/attention to bake protections into the process or am I too hopeful? Head to
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dvwXA2N) and share your thoughts!

## DVC-Hydra Integration

Did you hear? DVC has a new integration with Hydra. Now you can use Hydra
composition to configure your DVC experiments. You can also apend and remove
parameters on the fly as well as do a grid search of parameters. Random search
functionlity is coming,

## October Meetup

If you missed the October Meetup with
[**Nadia Nahar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-nahar-iit/) presenting her
team's research on _Collaboration Challenges in Building ML-Enabled Systems:
Communication, Documentation, Engineering, and Process_ don't worry, there's a
video! Catch it below!

## November Meetup

Join us for our next meetup on November 16th. We will have
[**Dmytro Filatov**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dim25/) of
[DeepX](https://deepxhub.com/) presenting _Continous Computer Vision with DVC

## Alex Kim - CI/CD for Machine Learning Webinar with ODSC

Join [**Alex Kim**](https://twitter.com/alex000kim) on November 30th with
[ODSC](https://opendatascience.com/) to learn about CI/CD for Machine Learning.
This webinar shares how CML is a project to help ML and data science
practitioners automate their ML model training and model evaluation, using best
practices and tools from software engineering, such as GitLab CI/CD (as well as
GitHub Actions and BitBucket Pipelines). The idea is to automatically train your
model and test it in a production-like environment every time your data or code
changes. In this talk, you'll learn how to:

- Automatically allocate cloud instances (AWS, Azure, GCP) to train ML models.
  And automatically shut the instance down when training is over
- Automatically generate reports with graphs and tables in pull/merge requests
  to summarize your model's performance, using any visualization library
- Transfer data between cloud storage and computing instances with DVC
- Customize your automation workflow with GitLab CI/CD
