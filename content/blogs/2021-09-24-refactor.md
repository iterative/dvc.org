  [Refactor](https://github.com/isidentical/refactor) is a source code
  refactoring engine. By taking advantage of the Python standard library's
  [AST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) module, we can find-and-fix
  patterns in massive codebases.

It is common for big codebases to grow to a complexity where it is nearly
impossible for someone to tediously and flawlessly refactor things manually
everywhere. The main problem with existing automated solutions (such as
regex-based find-and-replace tools) is that they treat source code like a plain
text document. This often results in false positives (tools making changes when
they shouldn't) and/or false negatives (not changing what they should). This is
primarily due to a lack of ability to truly encapsulate structural concepts of
the programming language: syntax and grammar that are impossible to manifest in
regexes.

This is where [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)s shine.
They are the common building blocks of source code; produced by a parser that
actually understands the language's syntax and creates a tree object where
smaller parts (e.g. tokens) are ordered in a way that they are related by their
syntactical meanings.

```python
password = input("password? ")
if password == secrets.get("my_password"):
    print("correct")
else:
    print("incorrect")
```

For example, the AST for the code above will look like this:

![Fundamentals of MLOps](../uploads/images/2021-09-24/ast.png) _Abstract Syntax
Tree_

The top-most "root" node of this tree represents a single Python file. Each file
consists of a number of statements (e.g. function definitions, loops, etc.). For
our example we have only 2 statements: an assignment (to `password`), and an
`if` statement. Each of these statements in turn has child nodes as defined by
[Python's ASDL](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#abstract-grammar).

## Refactoring source code through ASTs

[Refactor](https://github.com/isidentical/refactor) simplifies the process of
matching ASTs. It then applies your transformations to these ASTs without
touching the other parts of your source code.

For example, consider this code:

```python
foo = [
    1,
    2
]

foo_2 = ['a', *foo]

if foo[0] >= 1:
    assert secrets.get("foo") == foo
```

As a simple example, let's try to find and replace all instances of the `foo`
variable with `bar`... but without changing things inside strings or partial
matches like `foo_2`.

```python
import ast
import refactor
```

The first thing we need to do is define a rule. Each rule is a class that
defines a single entrypoint (`match())`), takes AST nodes from the tree, and
either rejects them (via raising an `AssertionError` or just returning `None`)
or accepts them (via returning a `refactor.Action`).

```python
class ReplaceFoo(refactor.Rule):

    def match(self, node):
```

Next, in the `match()` method, we will look for all `Name`s (which is what the
actual identifier is wrapped in), and check whether its `id` is `foo`.

```python
        assert isinstance(node, ast.Name)
        assert node.id == "foo"
```

If any of these assertions fail, the function will terminate and the engine will
move to the next `node` in the tree. But if we have a match, we need to return
some sort of an action. The simplest thing we can return is a
`refactor.ReplacementAction` which takes this `node` and replaces it with the
given argument.

```python
        return refactor.ReplacementAction(
            node,
            ast.Name("bar", node.ctx)
        )
```

And that's it! To run this refactoring, we can simply create a CLI application
from our rules via `refactor.run()`:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    refactor.run(rules=[ReplaceFoo])
```

If we run it on the file above, we will get this `diff`:

```diff
@@ -1,9 +1,9 @@
-foo = [
+bar = [
     1,
     2
 ]

-foo_2 = ['a', *foo]
+foo_2 = ['a', *bar]

-if foo[0] >= 1:
-    assert secrets.get("foo") == foo
+if bar[0] >= 1:
+    assert secrets.get("foo") == bar
```

All instances of the `foo` variable have been replaced, but items like `foo_2`
and `"foo"` are left alone as expected!

## Going Deeper

Obviously not all refactorings are as simple as this, so `refactor` is equipped
with more features like different actions, observers and representatives for
context manager. If you are curious about these and more advanced features, be
sure to check out the
[`refactor` documentation](https://refactor.readthedocs.io/en/latest)!
