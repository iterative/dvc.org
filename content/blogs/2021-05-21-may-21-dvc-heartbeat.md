# From the Community

It's been another month full of community goodness and we are grateful! Let's
get right to it!

![Thank you](https://media.giphy.com/media/jmqWAjoxFCxJNHD2Kz/giphy.gif)

### Curvenote with DVC tutorials

Interested in versioning your data AND your notebooks?  
[Steve Purves](https://twitter.com/stevejpurves) CTO and co-founder of
[Curvenote](https://curvenote.com/) gave a three-part tutuorial on integrating
DVC and Curvenote for creating reproducible, collaborative version control for
data scientists. The videos are beginner accessible with tips for intermediate
git users.
[Access the videos here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnNVbIEIO7A)

Curvenote for the version control win!_

### CML with Jenkins in DAGsHub

Next up, [Puneeth Pai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/puneeth-pai-b3b299a1/) of
[Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) wrote a two-part blog series with
a how-to for achieving continuous machine learning using DVC pipelines with
Jenkins and DAGsHub. Quoted in the article is our own
[David Ortega](https://github.com/DavidGOrtega),

> Treating experiments like potential new features in a software project opens
> up many possibilities for improving our engineering practices.

Check out these posts at the link below or catch Puneeth at our next
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DVC-Community-Virtual-Meetups/events/278163666/)
where he will be giving a high level overview of this content as well as
answering questions.

### Discord Server Explosion

Our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/dvwXA2N) has exploded since last
month, up 30% in membership 😱, thanks in large part to a
[**Towards Data Science**](https://towardsdatascience.com/) post from
[Sara Metwalli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-a-metwalli/) recommending
[**9 Discord Servers for Math, Python, and Data Science You Need to Join Today.**](https://towardsdatascience.com/9-discord-servers-for-math-python-and-data-science-you-need-to-join-today-34214b93d6b8)

Sara encourages readers to connect, learn and get inspired. 🚀 Thanks Sara!
We're on board with that! Rest assured our growing team is hard at work creating
content, improving tools and working on new tools 😶🤗 to continue to grow and
serve our MLOps community!

## Learning Opportunities

[Andrew NG](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg) of
[Deep Learning AI](https://twitter.com/DeepLearningAI_) and
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) fame has just released a new course
specializing in MLOps, called
[Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops?utm_campaign=20210423-mlep-1-program-email-mlep-launch&utm_medium=institutions&_hsmi=126760441&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9wSUanrnpyWNavtaCEzBLVpDXwatEig_ahaksJQhZO6dKkLRykfOxRwkpAZiipxWej4xs1uQgrXl-JCgB0M-Ha_vCUvEqaswIVZQhNd-jUDsE8SJs&utm_source=deeplearning-ai).
The course "combines the foundational concepts of machine learning with the
functional expertise of modern software development and engineering roles."
Methodologies and capabilities of MLOps are introduced while addressing the
challenges and consequences of machine learning engineering in production. I'm
signed up! 🙋🏻‍♀️ How 'bout you?

Next for your learning pleasure,
[Simone Scardapane](https://twitter.com/s_scardapane) is in the process of
fulfilling a "personal challenge" to create a PhD course for
[**Reproducible Deep Learning**](https://twitter.com/s_scardapane/status/1389240445788643329?s=20)
that includes the use of open source tools including our own DVC!
[Head to the link](https://github.com/sscardapane/reprodl2021) to star the repo
and cheer him on. We will be! 🙌🏼

You see what I did there, right? **Reproducible**... **Deep Learning**.....  
Get it? Layers of wit people. I learned from the best! Just wanted to make sure
you were paying attention!

# DVC News

We've hit 30 team members! Our team is distributed all over the world and has
grown so much that we now have two all-hands meetings! Affectionately called
UTC + and UTC -, these meetings honor all our different time zones while
allowing the other group to watch via recording when they are awake! You know
we're all about solving complicated problems. 💪🏼

three great talks. [Dmitry Petrov](https://twitter.com/FullStackML) gave a talk
on data versioning and machine learning experiments on top of Git.
[Elle O'Brien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drelleobrien/) gave a talk on
automating machine learning with Github action and GitLab CI. And finally,
[Mikhail Rozhkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mnrozhkov/) gave a talk on setting
up the workflow for machine learning batch scoring applications using DVC,
MLflow and Airflow. Be sure to check out all three talks and other great talks
from the week long Conference.
