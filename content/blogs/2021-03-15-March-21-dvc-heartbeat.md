## ICYMI - DVC 2.0 is here!

If you somehow missed our
[March 3rd announcment](https://dvc.org/blog/dvc-2-0-release), DVC 2.0 is here
with loads of features to make your life easier.

🧪 Lightweight ML experiments

📍 ML model checkpoints versioning

📈 Dvc-live - new open-source library for metrics logging

🔗 ML pipeline templating and iterative foreach-stages

🤖 CML - new way to get GPU/CPU in clouds and GitHub Actions

This video from the team gives you an overview of all the new features.

## And we keep on growing our worldwide team! 🌏

We have three new team members this month!

[**Laurens Duijvesteijn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duijf/) joins the team
from Utrecht, The Netherlands as a backend infrastructure engineer. Previously
he led a devops team at Channable where he learned that he really enjoys working
on developer tools and empowering people to do great work. When not solving dev
challenges, he enjoys bouldering/climbing, snowboarding and hiking! Welcome
Laurens!

[**Helio Machado**](https://github.com/0x2b3bfa0) joins our team from Spain as a
CML engineer! Helio comes from a heutogogic background, mainly focused on the
Free and Open Source culture and technologies from a systems perspective. You
will find his clever cryptograph handle helping you out in Discord with your CML
questions. Fun fact: Our two CML engineers, Helio and David Ortega live just 300
km apart in Spain! CML has some Spanish flare! 💃🏻🇪🇸

[**MikHail Rozhkov**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-rozhkov-33549118/)
joins us from Moscow, Russia as a Solution Engineer. Mikhail has been working
with DVC for 2+ years in the banking industry and is also the creator of the
[**Machine Learning REPA**](https://mlrepa.com) community as well as created our
[**first course on Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-experiments-and-engineering-with-dvc/).
We are so excited to have him officially join our team full-time!

## Open Positions

Come join our team! Open positions this month:

[TypeScript Front-End Engineer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aT5HZYt4kAUxXqD4JNTe3jPDlVUwSmnEWDPR2QoKdvo/edit)
to build SaaS and a VS Code UI for our popular machine learning tools: DVC and
CML. The ML tools ecosystem is what JS space was 10 years ago. Come join us on
this exciting project!

Our search continues for a
[Developer Advocate](https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/iterative-developer-advocate)
to support and inspire developers by creating new content like blogs, tutorials,
and videos - plus lead outreach through meetups and conferences.

Does this sound like you or someone you know? Be in touch!

## Dmitry featured on TFIR Insights

[**Swapnil Bhartiya**](https://twitter.com/tfir_io) of
[TFIR Insights](https://www.tfir.io/) interviewed our very own CEO,
[**Dmitry Petrov**](https://twitter.com/fullstackml), on his show discussing:

- Iterative.ai
- Why Open Source is a better approach for AI/ML
- DVC and CML
- Who should care about these tools
- How DVC and CML stack up against proprietary AI Platforms such as AWS
  SageMaker and Microsoft Azure ML Engineer

[**Elle O'Brien**](https://twitter.com/drelleobrien) presents her talk
"Automating ML with Continuous Integration" at the
[DataTalks.Club](http://datatalks.club/) Conference with
[**Alexey Grigorev**](https://twitter.com/Al_Grigor) and
[**Demtrios Brinkmann**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/) of
[MLOps Community](https://open.spotify.com/show/7wZygk3mUUqBaRbBGB1lgh). You can

## From the Community

### Using DVC in Lab Data Management

This great tutorial from [Matsui-lab Blog](https://mti-lab.github.io/blog/)
provides a solution using DVC for the data management problem labs face.

### Healthcare Use Case Video Tutorial

[**Danial Senejohnny**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danial-senejohnny/) created
this video outlining the use of DVC for healthcare institutes where the data
must be kept private and on premise data store is preferred. 👇🏼

## Scientific Journals 🧑🏻‍🔬

We are excited to announce a scientific paper purely devoted to DVC coming out
from Queen's University. This publication by
[**Amine Barrak**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amine-barrak-0bb99160/),
[**Ellis E Eghan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliseghan/) and
[**Bram Adams**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bramadams/), will be presented at
the 28th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and
Reengineering. You can check it out here. 👇🏼

## Tweet Love ❤️

From a Portuguese speaking community member in Finland...

> "The @DVCorg surely it is among the best tools of the ecosystem of the last 3
> years. It won't be long before DVC is as common as Scikit-Learn in ML / DS
> projects with high maturity. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"

O [@DVCorg](https://twitter.com/DVCorg) seguramente está entre as melhores
ferramentas do ecossistema dos últimos 3 anos. Não vai demorar para o DVC ser
tão comum quanto o Scikit-Learn em projetos de ML/DS com alta maturidade. 👏👏👏
