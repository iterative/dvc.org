Unlike most of the text you've read over the past two weeks, this Heartbeat was
100% human generated. üòâ

</admon>

Welcome to December! Wow, what a year! We introduced an online course, added
five new tools (TPI, GTO, MLEM, DVC Extension for VS Code, and a Model Registry
in Iterative Studio) plus tons of new features to DVC, CML, and Iterative
Studio. We also were thrilled to emerge from the pandemic and meet so many of
you in person at conferences around the world. We are excited about what's in
store for 2023, and we thank you all for being such fantastic community members.
While there are still challenging events happening around the globe, there is
much to be thankful for and victories to celebrate! Bring on 2023!

## From the Community

### MLOps Guide

For their engineering final project at [Insper,](https://www.insper.edu.br/en/)
[**Arthur Olga**](https://github.com/arthurolga),¬†[**Gabriel Monteiro**](https://github.com/gabriellm1),¬†[**Guilherme Leite**](https://github.com/guipleite),
¬†and¬†[**Vinicius Lima**](https://github.com/ViniGl) created the
[MLOps Guide](https://mlops-guide.github.io/), which provides a Complete MLOps
development cycle using DVC, CML, and IBM Watson. The multi-page guide covers
the principles of MLOps as well as a full tutorial for building an MLOps
environment. It covers data and model versioning, feature management and
storing, automation of pipelines and processes, CI/CD for machine learning, and
continuous monitoring of models. The guide uses both DVC and CML and includes
videos outlining the project and much of the coding, as well as a project
repository that you can work through.

### Turn VS Code Into a One-Stop Shop for ML Experiments

[**Eryk Lewinson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eryklewinson/) wrote a fabulous,
[in-depth tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/turn-vs-code-into-a-one-stop-shop-for-ml-experiments-49c97c47db27)
on experiment tracking using our new DVC Extension for VS Code. He starts off
with, ‚ÄúOne of the biggest threats to productivity in recent times is context
switching.‚Äù As a Community Manager, I can so relate! üòÖ¬†He posits that the
extension is a great way to both code our experiments and evaluate and compare
them happily in our IDE, without having to jump back and forth between
platforms.

![DVC Extension for VS Code Experiment Tracking](../uploads/images/2022-12-16/eryk-lewinson.gif)

Eryk uses a credit card risk dataset and project to show most of the
capabilities of the
[DVC Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iterative.dvc)
and take us through all the steps to show the entire workflow and the resulting
project structure. He notes the best points of the extension are its experiment
bookkeeping with an emphasis on reproducibility and its extended plotting
capabilities including live plotting to visualize model performance while the
model is still being trained. He goes over some tricks and functionality of the
extension as well.

### A Fable About MLOps...and Broken Dreams

![A Fable About MLOps...And Broken Dreams](../uploads/images/2022-12-16/alex-burlacu.png '=800')
_A Fable About MLOps... and Broken Dreams
([Source link](https://alexandruburlacu.github.io/posts/2022-11-22-mlops-fable))_

[**Alex Burlacu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandru-burlacu) tells a great
story and provides many tips on his experience in MLOps
[in this piece](https://alexandruburlacu.github.io/posts/2022-11-22-mlops-fable)
on his blog called _A Fable About MLOps... and Broken Dreams_. The tale is
likely all too familiar to many of you in our Community in addition to being
validating and entertaining to read. He offers some great prerequisites for
beginning your MLOps journey including quickly finding and accessing your data,
seeding that model training code, and recording your experiment configuration.
Last of these he recommends MLFlow, but as the previous summary from Eryk points
out, this can be done very effectively with the new DVC extension AND be truly
fully reproducible. ü§ó

Generally, he recommends starting early and starting small with MLOps. More
technically, he recommends a simple data collection and discovery system, data
versioning with DVC, replicable experiments, experiment tracking, ML serving,
testing, and CI/CD. It's all great advice and fun to read!

### ML Pipeline Decoupled - I managed to write a framework-agnostic ml pipeline with DVC, Rust, and Python

[**Sheikh Samsuzzhan Alam, aka Mr. Data Psycho**,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mr-data-psycho/)
writes
[this great piece](https://towardsdev.com/ml-pipeline-decoupled-i-managed-to-write-a-framework-agnostic-ml-pipeline-with-dvc-rust-python-287de68104c9)
that reminds us that DVC is language agnostic! While Python is the most popular
language used in Data Science and with DVC, there are some instances where you
may want to use languages such as Rust to speed up memory efficiency and offer a
faster solution for parts of your project. The good news is you can! Mr. Data
Psycho extols the virtues of DVC‚Äôs pipelining feature and shows how to use Rust
(Polars) as a pre-processing framework, Sci-kit Learn for model training, and
the rest in Python. Using the yaml files, each stage could be put together using
dependencies written in whatever language your heart desires! You can find the
repo for the project [here](https://github.com/DataPsycho/mlpipeline-with-dvc).

### Digital Cheatsheet for DVC

If you‚Äôd like an online CheatSheet for DVC you can find one
[here](https://cheat.sh/dvc) created by
[**Igor Chubin**](https://twitter.com/igor_chubin). Pick a command from the
drop-down menu and bam üí•, you‚Äôve got the info you need! It‚Äôs very cool, but do
always remember to check our docs [here](https://dvc.org/doc),
[here](https://cml.dev/doc), and [here](https://mlem.ai/doc); we are always
updating them!

### Akvelon enables non-Python apps to integrate machine learning models with MLEM

[this great tutorial](https://akvelon.com/akvelon-enables-non-python-apps-to-integrate-machine-learning-models-with-mlem/)
on using MLEM to make the process of integrating, packaging, and deploying
machine learning models much easier. In the tutorial, they show how to do this
with Akvelon‚Äôs .NET and Java clients for use in existing or new Web (ASP.Net,
Java Spring), Mobile (Xamarin, Android), and Desktop (WPF, WinForms, Java
Spring, Java Spring). Explore the project directory

## DVC Live Experiment Tracking

We‚Äôve been listening to the greater Community and know you‚Äôd like to see easier
experiment tracking from DVC and we‚Äôre on it!
[The latest release of DVCLive](https://iterative.ai/blog/exp-tracking-dvc-python?tab=DVC-extension-for-VS-Code)
helps bring that goal to fruition. Now you can track your experiments with only
a couple of lines of code directly from your notebook or your .py file. You can
start with just a repo with Git and DVC initialized, using your existing tools;
eliminating the need for a hosted solution or setting up a server or database.
Keep track of all the metadata related to the experiment in your Git provider of
choice (GitHub/GitLab), and your cloud storage, and share with your team when
you are ready. In addition, you can use Iterative Studio to share the results of
your experiments with teammates.

## New Unstructured Data Query Language

Do you use Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage? We have a new
solution for finding and managing your datasets of unstructured data like
images, audio files, and PDFs! Extend your DVC environment with the first
unstructured data query language (think SQL -> DQL) for machine learning. We are
looking for beta customers for this new tool.

[Schedule a meeting with us](https://calendly.com/gtm-2/iterative-datamgmt-overview)
if that's what you're needing!

## GTO Tutorial on the Blog

A model registry is a tool to catalog ML models and their versions. Models from
your data science projects can be discovered, tested, shared, deployed, and
audited from there. Learn how to build a model registry in a DVC Git repo
without involving any extra services, integrations, and APIs in
[this new post](https://iterative.ai/blog/gto-model-registry) from

## Flappy DeeVee

Our global, all-remote team works hard, but we also have fun! We have a weekly
All-Hands meeting where our teams report progress via pre-recorded video so that
everyone can be prepared to discuss the topic during the meeting.

As we all level up our video production skills, the videos have started to get
more fun!
