In the
[previous post](https://iterative.ai/blog/managing-openfoam-physical-simulations-with-dvc-cml-studio-part-1/),
we discussed how DVC simplifies physical simulation pipelines and data
management. This post discusses how to run simulations in the cloud, run new
experiments, and visualize simulation results with
[Iterative Studio](https://studio.datachain.ai/) and other tools.

In this post, you will learn how to:

1. Manage computational resources on AWS and start and shut down EC2 instances
   for simulation experiments.

2. Run new [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/) simulations in a cloud using
   Iterative Studio and [CML](https://cml.dev/).

3. Use Iterative Studio to view simulation results and DVC plots online.

This post is a result of collaboration between the
[Iterative.ai](http://iterative.ai) and
[PlasmaSolve](https://plasmasolve.com/about-us/) teams. PlasmaSolve was founded
in 2016 by plasma physicists and software engineers to provide a platform for
cutting-edge physics simulation services and research. The PlasmaSolve team
strives to deliver top-notch solutions and well-designed physics simulations to
speed up research and reduce development costs using various open-source and
commercial simulation tools.

# Run simulations in the cloud with GitLab and CML

<admon type="tip">

For this part of the post, we follow the `main` branch in the
[demo repository](https://gitlab.com/iterative.ai/cse_public/sonicfoam-demo/-/tree/main).
Please follow the
[README](https://gitlab.com/iterative.ai/cse_public/sonicfoam-demo/-/blob/main/README.md)
to prepare your environment and install dependencies.

</admon>

OpenFOAM simulations can be computationally intensive, requiring access to
high-performance computing resources or a cluster of computers to solve large or
complex problems.

To run the demo simulation in AWS we may apply
[CML (Continuous Machine Learning)](https://cml.dev/doc). CML can start a new
AWS EC2 instance to run a new simulation experiment and shut it down when it’s
done.

The full configuration for the demo CI pipeline can be found in the
[`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/iterative.ai/cse_public/sonicfoam-demo/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml)
file.

The demo project shows an example of how to integrate CML into GitLab CI
configuration. The pipeline has two stages: `build` and `run`. The `build` stage
has a single job that builds a docker image based on the specified `Dockerfile`,
pushes the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and logs in to the
registry. The `run` stage has three jobs: `launch`, `run`, and `report`. The
`launch` job launches an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the `run`
job runs a simulation on the instance. The `report` job generates a report on
the simulation results. Visual representations of the CI pipeline and used AWS
services are shown in the diagram below.

## Using AWS computational resources

When a workflow requires computational resources (such as GPUs), CML can
automatically allocate cloud instances using 
[cml runner](https://cml.dev/doc/ref/runner). You can spin up instances on AWS,
Azure, GCP, or Kubernetes
([see below](https://cml.dev/doc/self-hosted-runners#cloud-compute-resource-credentials)).
Alternatively, you can connect to
[any other computing provider or an on-premise (local) machine](https://cml.dev/doc/self-hosted-runners#on-premise-local-runners).

Below is an example of the GitLab CI `launch` job configuration that allocates
AWS instances using `cml runner` command. Users may define the region, instance
type, and storage size that are needed:

```yaml
launch:
  stage: run
  rules:
    - changes: [dvc.yaml, params.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml]
  image: iterativeai/cml:0-dvc2-base1
  script: >
    cml runner launch  
    --cloud=aws  
    --cloud-region=$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION --cloud-type=m5.2xlarge  
    --cloud-hdd-size=32  --labels=cml
    --docker-volumes="/home/.cml/cache:/home/.cml/cache"
```

## Setup CI jobs to run a simulation

To run a new simulation experiment using the `cml runner` we need to specify the
`cml` tag in the `run` job and run `dvc exp run` command.

```yaml
run:
  stage: run
  tags: [cml]
  rules:
    - changes: [params.yaml, .gitlab-ci.yml]
  image:  ${AWS_CONTAINER_IMAGE}
  script:
    ...
    # Run an experiment
    - dvc pull || echo "Pull failed"  # Pull outputs of previous simulation if any
    - dvc exp run -f
    - dvc push # Save results
    - rsync -r ./ /home/.cml/cache/run # Share results with 'report' job
```

Using `dvc pull` command helps to download the results of the previous
experiments from the remote storage. Checking versions of previous results and
DVC pipeline stage dependencies, DVC may skip running stages that do not need to
be run and save a lot of time and computational resources. After the simulation
completes, `dvc push` uploads the new results back to the remote storage.

After the `run` job completes, the `report` job prepares and publishes the CML
report to the associated Git commit. For this, we need to build a `report.md`
file with all text & plots in Markdown format, and use the `cml comment create`
command to publish this report and create a pull request.

```yaml
report:
  ...
  image: iterativeai/cml:0-dvc2-base1 # Python, DVC, & CML pre-installed
  script:
    ...
    # Create CML report
    - |
      cat <<EOF > report.md
      ...
      ![](sonicFoam/postProcessing/float_pressure.png)
      EOF
    - cml comment create --publish-native report.md
    - cml pr create .
```

In some cases, these reports may help to collaborate with teammates using a Git
workflow.

## Setup GitLab CI variables

To run simulations in AWS with GitLab CI & CML, it's recommended to use
provider-managed policies/roles and then explicitly limit the permissions
further if possible.
[Here is a set of common permissions required by CML](https://cml.dev/doc/ref/runner?tab=AWS#common-permissions).

In this demo we used the following CI variables in the project
`Settings → CI/CD → Variables`:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` - it is optional and depends on the AWS organization
  settings.
- `REPO_TOKEN` - a
  [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
  with the `api`, `read_repository` and `write_repository` scopes. Find more
  details in
  [CML docs on Personal Access Token](https://cml.dev/doc/self-hosted-runners?tab=GitLab#personal-access-token)

![Examples of CI variables in GitLab](../uploads/images/2023-05-10/ci_vars.png)_Examples
of CI variables in GitLab_

<admon type="tip">

Note: → AWS_SESSION_TOKEN is not required for most users. It’s specific to
Iterative's sandbox account. → REPO_TOKEN - a personal access token with the
api, read_repository and write_repository scopes. Find more details in CML docs
on
[Personal Access Token.](https://cml.dev/doc/self-hosted-runners#personal-access-token)

# Experimenting and visualization simulation results in Iterative Studio

[Iterative Studio](https://studio.datachain.ai/) is a web application that you
can access online or even host on-prem. Using the power of leading open-source
tools [DVC](https://dvc.org/), [CML](https://cml.dev/),
and [Git](https://git-scm.com/), enables you to seamlessly manage data, run and
track experiments, and visualize and share results.

## Run a new simulation

Using Iterative Studio we can run new simulation experiments in the Cloud and
visualize results in Studio UI.

## Visualize simulation results

Iterative Studio helps to visualize simulation result images and DVC plots just
after the simulation is complete. Studio allows one to plot images and metrics,
and compare them with previous simulations.

simulation results in Iterative Studio_

# Visualize the simulation outputs with ParaView

OpenFOAM includes several utilities for visualizing simulation results,
including ParaView, which is a popular open-source visualization tool. Users can
use these tools to generate plots, contour plots, and volume renderings of
simulation results.

DVC can help to download the simulation outputs and visualize them locally. One
could do a simple command to get all the data generated by the simulation:

```cli
$ dvc exp pull
```

Downloaded data can be visualized with third-party tools like ParaView.

# Summary

This post details how Iterative tools help in physical and computational
simulations. For this purpose, we created a demo project built with OpenFOAM.
The demo shows how to set up DVC for simulation experiments and data management.
CML is used in the GitLab CI pipeline to manage computational resources on AWS.
Iterative Studio is then used as a UI to visualize simulation results and run
new simulations in a few clicks.

Overall, DVC, CML, and Iterative Studio can help OpenFOAM users:

1. Reduce the complexity of simulation pipelines and automate tasks such as
   running simulations, post-processing results, and generating reports.

2. Manage and track the data and code associated with your OpenFOAM simulations,
   and make it easier to reproduce simulation results. Store simulation data
   on-premises or in the cloud using a variety of storage types, such as S3.

3. Manage simulation experiments with simple YAML config files.

4. Manage computational resources on AWS and start and shut down EC2 instances
   for simulation experiments.

5. Iterative Studio provides a user-friendly interface for simulation results,
   visualization, and running new simulations quickly.

6. Iterative Studio allows users to view and share simulation results and DVC
   plots online, without the need to download and visualize results locally.
