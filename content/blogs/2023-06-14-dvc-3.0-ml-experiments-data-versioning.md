title: 'The DVC 3.0 Stack: Beyond the Command Line'
date: 2023-06-14
description: |
  DVC 3.0 introduces a stack of tools outside the command line to bring it closer to
  where you work (in code, IDE, web) while also focusing on DVC fundamentals.
descriptionLong: |
  DVC has brought engineering best practices to the ML and data world, making model
  development more standardized and reproducible. Now we want to make it work when the
  command line isn't the right fit, and it's easier to work in code, an IDE, or on the
  web. This doesn't mean we forgot about DVC fundamentals -- data versioning is the core
  of what we do.

[DVC 3.0] helps you [experiment](#experiment-tracking-and-beyond), from notebook
exploration to model management, and works smarter with your
[cloud/remote storage](#smarter-cloudremote-storage) to make data versioning
painless.

## Experiment Tracking and Beyond

In [DVC 2.0], we first released DVC experiments, providing a way to track
experiments as hidden, [lightweight Git commits], so you don't have to
separately manage your experiments and code. Now it's easier to [start tracking
experiments] from your Python script or notebook (see examples). You only need a
Git repo and DVC's Python logging library [DVCLive]. You don't need prior DVC
knowledge or an existing DVC project.

...

trainer = Trainer(logger=DVCLiveLogger(save_dvc_exp=True))
trainer.fit(model)
```

from dvclive.huggingface import DVCLiveCallback

trainer.add_callback(DVCLiveCallback(save_dvc_exp=True))
trainer.train()

<tab title="Keras">

```python
from dvclive.keras import DVCLiveCallback

...

model.fit(
  train_dataset, validation_data=validation_dataset,
  callbacks=[DVCLiveCallback(save_dvc_exp=True)])
```

</tab>

<tab title="General Python API">

```python
from dvclive import Live

with Live(save_dvc_exp=True) as live:
    live.log_param("epochs", NUM_EPOCHS)

    for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
        train_model(...)
        metrics = evaluate_model(...)
        for metric_name, value in metrics.items():
            live.log_metric(metric_name, value)
        live.next_step()
```

With the [DVC extension for VS Code], you get an experiment tracking workbench
without any servers or logins.

### Hyperparameter Optimization

DVC can also help you do hyperparameter optimization by integrating with other
tools. You can [queue] an entire grid search of experiments, configure multiple
complex model architectures with [Hydra] integration, and track your [Optuna]
studies.

## Smarter Cloud/Remote Storage

We are committed to building the best data versioning experience. This means
making DVC work with your existing data stack and not trying to replace it. We
have focused on working more closely with cloud storage (and non-cloud storage)
by making DVC not only faster but smarter.

### Minimizing Downloads

Avoiding unnecessary downloads saves time and space that could never be
accomplished by transfer speedups alone. You can now [add or modify] individual
files in a larger dataset. If you have a large dataset in remote storage, you
can pull and modify any file without needing to download the full dataset.

![partial-add](../uploads/images/2023-06-14/dvc-part-update.gif 'Add or modify files in a dataset.')

You can also run or verify a pipeline [without pulling data] first. You can skip
downloading data for stages that haven't changed and automatically download only
the data needed for stages that have changed.

### Cloud Versioning

You shouldn't have to create extra copies of data that's already backed up and
versioned on the cloud. DVC [cloud versioning] enables you to import data that's
already versioned by your cloud provider. In the example below, DVC knows not to
push any data to its own storage because it is already versioned by the cloud.
Pulling the data later will recover it from its original source location.

```cli
$ dvc import-url --version-aware s3://mybucket/data
Importing 's3://mybucket/data' -> 'data'

$ dvc push
Everything is up to date.
```

### Pythonic API

You may need to work with your cloud data outside of the command-line workflow
of pushing and pulling. The [DVCFileSystem] API enables you to read and manage
files and directories from remote DVC repos like you would for a local
filesystem. In the example below, each file in the `data/prepared` directory is
streamed in as text.

```python
>>> from dvc.api import DVCFileSystem
>>> repo = "https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started.git"
>>> fs = DVCFileSystem(repo, rev="main")
>>> for f in fs.find("data/prepared"):
...     text = fs.read_text(f)
...     # process the data
```

### Faster Performance

Sometimes you just need faster performance, especially for large data downloads
and uploads. We have focused on improving performance where it matters most. For
example, pushing data to S3 is 2.5x faster in DVC 3.0 than in early versions of
DVC 2.x according to our benchmarks.

# Thank You!

Our constant interaction with the DVC community gives us feedback on what should
be improved. We heard from you that the ML landscape is already complex and you
want to keep your tools simple. That's why many of the new "features" are
improvements to existing functionality, and why we are building this stack of
tools to make DVC easier, more flexible, and the solid choice for your MLOps
workflows.

Finally, none of these improvements would be possible without the support of the
teams who work on the entire DVC stack.

Thanks to all of you who make DVC and its community what it is!
