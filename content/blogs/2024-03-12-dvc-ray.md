Training models at the scale of the Gemini or GPT-4 models requires advanced
tools that manage complexity while ensuring efficiency. This tutorial explores
how Data Version Control (DVC) can be a game-changer for ambitious projects. DVC
simplifies AI development by automating pipelines, managing versions, and
tracking experiments while embracing GitOps for reproducibility. It excels in
both local and cloud environments for traditional ML workflows. However, the
rise of Generative AI and complex deep learning projects demands scalable,
distributed training solutions.

This tutorial is divided into two parts. Part 1 sets the foundation for scalable
and efficient machine learning workflows by leveraging Ray‚Äôs distributed
computing capabilities and DVC‚Äôs data version control.

In [Part 2](/blog/dvc-ray-part-2), we extend the solution to a Ray Cluster on
AWS, demonstrating how to adapt the setup for cloud-based distributed computing.
This involves configuring AWS resources, deploying Ray clusters in the cloud,
and running DVC-managed pipelines at scale.

## ‚≠ê Get Started with Ray

### 1 - Overview of the Ray Framework

[Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/index.html) is a framework for
scaling AI and Python applications. For AI and ML applications, Ray helps to
scale jobs without needing infrastructure expertise:

- Efficiently parallelize and distribute ML workloads across multiple nodes and
  GPUs.
- Leverage the ML ecosystem with native and extensible integrations.

![Stack of Ray libraries - a unified toolkit for ML workloads](../uploads/images/2024-03-12/4-ray-stack.png '=600')
_Stack of Ray libraries - A Unified Toolkit For ML Workloads
([Ray Docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/index.html))_

In this tutorial, we work with Ray Clusters and Ray AI Libraries (Ray Tune and
Ray Train).
[Ray Cluster](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/getting-started.html) is a
set of
[Worker nodes](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/key-concepts.html#cluster-worker-nodes)
connected to a common Ray
[Head node](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/key-concepts.html#cluster-head-node).

- The Head node serves as the central coordination point for the Ray cluster. It
  manages the cluster‚Äôs metadata, maintains the cluster state, and handles task
  scheduling and management.
- Worker nodes are the computational workhorses of the Ray cluster. They are
  responsible for executing tasks and running computations for applications.

![Two nodes Ray Cluster](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/_images/ray-cluster.svg)
_A Ray cluster with two worker nodes. Each node runs Ray helper processes to
facilitate distributed scheduling and memory management. The head node runs
additional control processes (highlighted in blue). Source:
[Ray Docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/key-concepts.html#head-node)_

Ray clusters can be fixed-size or autoscale up and down according to the
resources requested by applications running on the cluster.

[Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) is a Python Library
that automates the hyperparameter tuning process across distributed resources.
By integrating Ray Tune into the experiment workflow, we can evaluate numerous
hyperparameter combinations in parallel, speeding up the search for optimal
model configurations.

![Distributed tuning with Ray](../uploads/images/2024-03-12/5-ray-tune.png '=600')
_Distributed tuning with distributed training per trial. Source:
[Ray Docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/use-cases.html)_

[Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html) creates a setup to
scale model training code from a single machine to a cluster of machines in the
cloud and abstracts away the complexities of distributed computing. At a high
level of abstraction, it distributes and runs training jobs among worker nodes.

[Ray Docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/overview.html)_

### 2 - Start a Ray Cluster

> üí° Navigate to the `main` branch in the repository

To start a Ray Cluster, first initiate the Ray head node. The head node is the
primary node in the Ray cluster that manages the worker nodes. Since this is a
local setup, your machine will act as both the Head and Worker nodes. Use the
following command:

```bash
ray start --head
```

This command starts the Ray cluster with your machine acting as the head node.

To monitor and debug Ray, view the dashboard at
[http://127.0.0.1:8265/](http://127.0.0.1:8265/).

![Ray Dashboard](../uploads/images/2024-03-12/7-ray-dashboard.png '=600') _Ray
Dashboard - Cluster Nodes_

> üí° Multi-node Ray clusters are only supported on Linux. You may deploy Windows
> and OSX clusters for development by setting the environment
> variable¬†`RAY_ENABLE_WINDOWS_OR_OSX_CLUSTER=1`. Source:
> [Ray Clusters Overview](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/getting-started.html).

### 3 - Run a test script on the Ray Cluster

You can run a simple test script to ensure your local Ray cluster works
correctly. In your project directory, create a file named **`hello_cluster.py`**
inside the **`src/test_scripts`** directory. Add a script to connect to the Ray
cluster and print a message. Here‚Äôs an example script:

```python
import ray

@ray.remote
def hello_world():
    return ‚ÄúHello Ray cluster‚Äù

# Automatically connect to the running Ray cluster.
ray.init()
print(ray.get(hello_world.remote()))
```

Execute the script using Python. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python src/test_scripts/hello_cluster.py
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```bash
2023-11-14 12:11:17,363 INFO worker.py:1489 -- Connecting to existing Ray cluster at address: 192.168.100.19:6379...
2023-11-14 12:11:17,370 INFO worker.py:1664 -- Connected to Ray cluster. View the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8265
Hello Ray cluster
```

This output indicates that your script has successfully connected to the local
Ray cluster and executed the print statement.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run DVC Pipeline on a Ray Cluster

You have a single-node Ray Cluster at this step on your local machine. Let‚Äôs
start with the DVC pipeline setup.

Goals for this section:

- Design a Solution for DVC + Ray.
- Create a DVC pipeline with two stages: tune and train.
- Modify DVCLive to sync metrics and parameters with DVC Studio.

### 1 - Design Solution for DVC + Ray

The technical design calls for a structure where ML experiment scripts, managed
by DVC, invoke Ray for their computation needs. DVC is the orchestrator,
invoking the appropriate Ray functions for distributed processing.

![Design POC Solution for DVC + Ray (local)](../uploads/images/2024-03-12/8-solution-design-local.png '=600')
_Design POC Solution for DVC + Ray (local)_

This diagram outlines the integration of DVC (Data Version Control) with a Ray
cluster for running ML experiments in a distributed manner:

1. DVC initiates the process by running a stage script. The `dvc.yaml` pipeline
   definition is the blueprint for the ML workflow, defining stages that utilize
   Ray for hyperparameter tuning and subsequent training stages.
2. Ray Job Submission: The stage script (e.g., `src/stages/tune.py`) starts a
   Ray application that submits computation jobs to Ray. The
   `src/stages/tune.py` script utilizes Ray Tune‚Äôs `Tuner` class to define and
   run the hyperparameter tuning trials.
3. Ray Cluster contains a single Head Node where the actual computation occurs.
   (Note: In the production cluster, Ray runs the jobs distributed across
   multiple worker nodes). Ray saves results for each job (trial) to a local
   directory in a worker node (outside the DVC project repo).
4. After all jobs complete, the stage script retrieves results from Ray‚Äôs trial
   directories to the DVC project repo (if needed).
5. DVC manages the outputs of the pipeline, ensuring reproducibility and
   traceability.

The result is a robust framework for conducting and managing ML experiments that
are scalable, reproducible, and efficiently optimized. This framework not only
streamlines the experimentation process but also simplifies the transition of
models from development to production.

### 2 - Create a DVC pipeline

In this tutorial, the `dvc.yaml` file contains only two stages in the ML
pipeline: `tune` and `train`.

![DVC pipeline](../uploads/images/2024-03-12/9-dvc-pipeline.png '=600') _DVC
pipeline configuration in `dvc.yaml` with `tune` and `train` stages, and `plots`
sections_

#### Tune Stage

This initial stage is responsible for hyperparameter tuning. It uses Ray to
distribute the computation involved in this process. The stage executes a Python
script `tune.py` that optimizes hyperparameters using the Ray Tune. The output
of this stage is `best_params.yaml`, which contains the best hyperparameters
found during the tuning process.

```yaml
tune:
  cmd: python src/stages/tune.py --config params.yaml
  params:
    - tune
  outs:
    - ${tune.results_dir}/best_params.yaml:
        cache: false
        persist: true
```

Use two specific configuration parameters for the `best_params.yaml` output:

- Set `cache: false` to instruct DVC not to cache the file but version it with
  Git.
- Set `persist: true` to instruct DVC not to remove the file before reproducing
  the stage. It‚Äôs useful for stage dependencies when you work in an unstable
  environment (or debugging), and the stage script can fail for any reason. In
  this example, even if the `tune` stage fails, you can run the `train` stage
  using `best_params.yaml` from the previous run.

#### Train Stage

The Train Stage runs distributed computation via Ray. This stage depends on
`best_params.yaml` generated by the `tune` stage to access the optimal
hyperparameters for training the model. The `train` stage is invoked by the
`train.py` script, which will train the model based on the tuned parameters.

```yaml
train:
  cmd: python src/stages/train.py --config params.yaml
  params:
    - train
  deps:
    - ${tune.results_dir}/best_params.yaml
  outs:
    - ${train.results_dir}/model.pth
```

The trained model is saved as `model.pth`, with the path again parameterized to
allow flexibility in the output location. The output model is automatically
cached and versioned with DVC.

### 3 - Run DVC pipelines on Ray Cluster

To execute your automated and distributed ML pipeline with DVC, perform the
following steps:

- Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to ensure Python scripts can access
  modules within your project‚Äôs directory by setting the `PYTHONPATH`
  environment variable.
- Run DVC pipeline with `dvc exp run` command.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
dvc exp run
```

This will start the pipeline, running the `tune` and `train` stages as defined
in your `dvc.yaml` file, utilizing distributed computation with Ray.

You may see live updates of metrics and plots in
[DVC Studio](https://studio.datachain.ai/) and
[DVC Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iterative.dvc).
DVC can generate and render plots based on your project‚Äôs data. Metrics and
plots logged with DVCLive can be visualized in DVC Studio and DVC Extension for
VS Code.

A few benefits of tracking and visualizing metrics and plots with DVC
([see docs](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/visualizing-plots)):

- Enhanced Experiment Tracking: Compare metrics, parameters, version of data,
  and plots between experiments in a live mode.
- Customize Visualization: Define visualization template, select data to be
  visualized and titles interactively, before or after the experiment is
  complete (docs:
  [Defining plots](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/visualizing-plots#defining-plots)).
- Share & Version Control for Metrics: You can
  send¬†[live metrics and plots](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/sharing-experiments#live-metrics-and-plots)¬†to¬†[DVC Studio](https://studio.datachain.ai/),¬†[push](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/sharing-experiments#push-experiments)¬†completed¬†experiments¬†(including
  data, models, and code), and convert an experiment into
  a¬†[persistent](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/sharing-experiments#persist-experiment)¬†branch
  or commit in your Git repo (docs
  [Sharing Experiments](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management/sharing-experiments)).

## üí¨ Discuss the Solution Design

This section above explains a simple example of running DVC and Ray together.
It‚Äôs not a production setup. But it‚Äôs a good start for developing and debugging
the DVC pipeline with Ray.

Let‚Äôs think about what decisions we made and discuss some details:

1. Use DVC to run scripts calling Ray API.
2. Persist DVC stage outputs to keep them available for downstream stages in
   case of failure.
3. Use DVCLive to track metrics only on a worker with a rank of 0.
4. Propagate DVC environment variables to a worker node using TorchTrainer
   `train_loop_config`.
5. Copy the `model.pth` file from the Ray Trial folder to the DVC project
   repository.

### ‚òùÔ∏è Use DVC to run scripts calling Ray API

Ray framework provides a rich Python API for distributed data processing, model
tuning, and training. Wrapping Ray scripts into callable Python modules
simplifies using DVC. Therefore, you get two benefits:

- Get scalability and distributed training with Ray
- Get reproducibility and versioning with DVC

A template of the `dvc.yaml` for DVC + Ray:

```yaml
stages:

  first_stage:
    cmd: python first_script_with_ray.py
    ...

  next_stage:
    cmd: python second_script_with_ray.py
    ...
```

### ‚òùÔ∏è Persist DVC stage outputs to keep them available for downstream stages in case of failure

Set `persist: true` to instruct DVC not to remove the file before reproducing
the stage. It‚Äôs useful for stage dependencies when you work in an unstable
environment (or debugging), and the stage script might fail.

```yaml
stages:
  first_stage:
    cmd: python first_script_with_ray.py
    outs:
      - stage_output.file:
          persist: true
```

### ‚òùÔ∏è **Use DVCLive to track live metrics updates with DVC Studio and [DVC Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iterative.dvc)**

Ray Train lets you use native experiment¬†tracking¬†libraries inside
the¬†[train_func](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/overview.html#train-overview-training-function)¬†function.
[DVCLive](https://dvc.org/doc/dvclive) is a highly flexible and lightweight
library that simplifies experiment tracking in DVC projects.

```python
from dvclive import Live

with Live() as live:
    live.log_metric(metric_name, value)
```

This solution uses log metrics with `Live()` inside
`the train_func_per_worker()` function.

One significant distinction between distributed and non-distributed training
lies in the parallel execution of multiple processes in distributed training
setups, which may yield identical results under specific configurations. When
all processes communicate results to the tracking backend, there‚Äôs a risk of
receiving duplicate entries (check
[Ray docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/user-guides/experiment-tracking.html)
for details).

Therefore, a few adjustments should be made to DVCLive.

1. Use DVCLive to track metrics only on a worker with a rank of 0.
2. Use the `DVC_ROOT` variable to create the `Live(dir=...)` object. DVC
   automatically sets the value for the `DVC_ROOT` variable to the directory of
   your DVC repository and ensures Ray writes metrics inside the repo
   ([docs](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/env)).

As a result, the DVCLive usage code inside the `train_func_per_worker()`
function looks like the example below.

```python
# train.py

def train_func_per_worker(config: Dict):

    # Initialize DVC Live
    live = None
    rank = ray.train.get_context().get_world_rank()

    # Create a Live object on the rank 0 worker
    if rank == 0:
      live = Live(
          dir=os.path.join(os.environ.get("DVC_ROOT",""), "results/dvclive"),
      )

    for epoch in range(epochs):
      # ...epoch training

      # Log metrics with print()
      if live:
          live.log_metric("loss", test_loss)
          live.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
          live.next_step()
```

Utilizing DVCLive in Python code for logging metrics and plots automatically
generates the necessary configurations for plots within the dvc.yaml file. Below
is an example configuration for metrics and plots:

```yaml
metrics:
  - results/dvclive/metrics.json
plots:
  - accuracy:
      x: step
      y:
        results/dvclive/plots/metrics/accuracy.tsv: accuracy
      title: Accuracy
      x_label: Step
      y_label: Accuracy
  - loss:
      template: simple
      x: step
      y:
        results/dvclive/plots/metrics/loss.tsv: loss
      title: Loss
      x_label: Step
      y_label: Accuracy
  - results/tune/plots/images
```

The train stage logs metrics and plots to results/dvclive. Datapoints for
metrics and plots are saved in files and visualized later in DVC Studio and VS
Code.  
![Metrics and plot](../uploads/images/2024-03-12/10-2-train-metrics.png '=600') _Metrics
plot generated by the `tune` stage_

The tune stage logs a mean_accuracy_plot.png file to visualize metrics for
tuning trials.

_Metrics plot generated by the `tune` stage_

### ‚òùÔ∏è Propagate DVC environment variables to Worker nodes

DVC environment variables are necessary for every Ray worker because they
provide essential information and configurations for DVCLive, facilitating
experiment tracking. These variables include:

1. **DVC_STUDIO_REPO_URL**: Repository URL where DVC stores versioned data.
2. **DVC_STUDIO_TOKEN**: Authentication token for secure access to DVC Studio.
3. **DVC_STUDIO_URL**: Web interface URL for managing DVC projects.
4. **DVC_EXP_BASELINE_REV**: Baseline revision for comparing experiment results.
5. **DVC_EXP_NAME**: Descriptive identifier for the experiment.
6. **DVC_ROOT**: Root directory of the DVC project on the filesystem.

> üí° Note: All environment variables above are set by DVC automatically when
> running a pipeline.

You don‚Äôt need to care about DVC environment variables when running DVC in a
non-distributed environment. However, running it in Ray Cluster requires setting
up on every worker. In this solution, DVC environment variables are passed via
[RuntimeEnv](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/api/doc/ray.runtime_env.RuntimeEnv.html#ray.runtime_env.RuntimeEnv)
to specify a runtime environment for the whole job.

![Set up Environment Variables](../uploads/images/2024-03-12/12-env-vars.png '=600')
_Set up DVC Environment Variables_

The code snippet below demonstrates an approach to managing DVC environment
variables within a TorchTrainer setup.

```python
def train_func_per_worker(config: Dict):
    #...
    if rank == 0:
        live = Live(
            dir=os.path.join(os.environ.get("DVC_ROOT",""), "results/dvclive"),
        )

def train(params: dict) -> None:
    #...
    trainer = TorchTrainer(

    # [1] Propogate DVC environment variables from Head Node to Workers
    # =============================================
    DVC_ENV_VARS = {k: v for k, v in os.environ.items() if  k.startswith("DVC")}
    ray.init(runtime_env=RuntimeEnv(env_vars=DVC_ENV_VARS))

    train(params)
```

- To ensure that DVC environment variables are accessible within the training
  loop across all worker nodes, `RuntimeEnv` propagates these variables from the
  head node to the workers.

### ‚òùÔ∏è Copy the `model.pth` file from the Ray Trial folder to the DVC project repository

Upon completing the training process, the `model.pth` file is saved in the Ray
Trial folder. Therefore, it‚Äôs copied to the DVC project repository (as shown in
the code example above).

This ensures that the trained model file is appropriately stored within the
DVC-managed project structure, facilitating version control and reproducibility.

## üé® Summing Up: DVC + Ray Integration

The DVC + Ray integration presents a comprehensive solution to the challenges of
running machine learning experiments at scale. By addressing specific issues
related to auto-scaling, execution optimization, live metrics tracking, and data
synchronization, this setup ensures that machine learning teams can focus on
innovation and experimentation backed by a robust, scalable, and efficient
infrastructure.

In Part 1 of the tutorial, we explored the basics of setting up and integrating
DVC with Ray for distributed machine learning workflows. We covered the
following key topics:

- **Introduction to Ray**: We discussed Ray‚Äôs capabilities for scaling AI and
  Python applications, focusing on its ability to parallelize and distribute ML
  workloads across multiple nodes easily.
- **Ray Clusters**: The architecture of Ray clusters was explained, highlighting
  the roles of head and worker nodes in managing and executing tasks.
- **Ray Tune and Ray Train**: We introduced Ray Tune for hyperparameter
  optimization and Ray Train for scaling model training code, emphasizing their
  integration into ML workflows.
- **Local Ray Cluster Setup**: Step-by-step instructions were provided for
  starting a Ray Cluster locally, showcasing how to test the setup with a simple
  script.

### Key Takeaways

The key takeaway from Part 1 is the foundation it sets for scalable and
efficient machine learning workflows. By leveraging Ray‚Äôs distributed computing
capabilities and DVC‚Äôs data version control, we establish a robust framework for
managing complex ML experiments. This combination enhances scalability,
reproducibility, and collaboration in ML projects.

### Looking Ahead to Part 2

In Part 2 of the tutorial, we will extend the solution to a Ray Cluster on AWS,
demonstrating how to adapt the setup for cloud-based distributed computing. This
will involve configuring AWS resources, deploying Ray clusters in the cloud, and
running DVC-managed pipelines at scale. The focus will shift towards managing
the increased complexity and leveraging cloud infrastructure to maximize the
efficiency and performance of ML experiments.

Stay tuned for detailed instructions on deploying and managing cloud-based Ray
clusters with DVC as we take the scalability and efficiency of ML workflows to
the next level.
