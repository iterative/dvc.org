**[DVC](https://dvc.org/)** is an open-source tool that brings agility and
reproducibility to data science projects by treating data and model training
pipelines as software. It connects versioned data sources and code with
pipelines, track experiments, register models — all based on GitOps principles.

**[Evidently](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently)** is an open-source
Python library to evaluate, test, and
[monitor ML models](https://www.evidentlyai.com/ml-in-production/model-monitoring).
It has 100+ built-in metrics and tests on data quality, data drift, and model
performance and helps interactively visualize them.

When used together, DVC and Evidently tools offer a comprehensive solution for
training, predicting, and monitoring ML models.

## 🚀 Run ML monitoring example

Now, let’s launch the pre-built example to run monitoring pipelines and manage
monitoring artifacts using DVC and Evidently.

### 1. Running the `train` pipeline

To run the entire pipeline, execute a simple command in your terminal. Make sure
you're in the project's root directory:

```bash
$ dvc exp run pipelines/train/dvc.yaml
```

This command runs the stages defined in the `dvc.yaml` file located in
`pipelines/train`. DVC experiments allow you to track changes made during each
run, making it easier to iterate and improve your model. Here’s what happens in
each stage:

- **load_data**:
  - Downloads and unzips the dataset into your `data/` directory.
- **extract_data**:
  - Executes `src/stages/extract_data.py`, using parameters from
    `pipelines/train/params.yaml`.
  - Outputs training and testing datasets to specified paths.
- **train**:
  - Runs `train.py`, training the model with the training data.
  - Saves the model to `models/model.joblib`
- **evaluate**:
  - Runs `evaluate.py` to assess the model on the test data.
  - Outputs reference data for monitoring to `data/reference_data.csv`.
  - Builds the model performance report using Evidently Regression Preset and
    saves it to `reports/train/model_performance.html`.
  - Saves metrics to `reports/train/metrics.json`.

After the pipeline is complete, you can

- (1) visualize training metrics
  [DVC Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iterative.dvc)
  ,
- (2) open the detailed model performance HTML report built with Evidently in
  the browser.

_Metrics and reports for Training pipeline_

> 💡 Note: Make sure you have the
> [DVC Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iterative.dvc)
> installed.

### 2. Running the `predict` pipeline

Once your model is trained and evaluated, the next vital step is to perform
predictions on new data. To run the pipeline, execute the following command in
your terminal:

```bash
$ dvc repro pipelines/predict/dvc.yaml
```

Here’s what happens in each stage:

- **predict**:
  - Executes `src/stages/predict.py`, using parameters from
    `pipelines/predict/params.yaml`.
  - Saves predictions to a CSV file, formatted as
    `data/predictions/${predict.week_start}--${predict.week_end}.csv`.
    Parameters `week_start` and `week_end` are located in the corresponding
    `params.yaml` file.

DVC automatically starts versioning control for the saved CSV file. You can now
push the data to remote storage in Clouds.

### 3. Run `monitor` pipeline

The monitor pipeline consists of two key stages: `monitor_data` and
`monitor_model`. These stages are crucial for ensuring your machine learning
models' ongoing health and performance.

```bash
$ dvc repro pipelines/monitor/dvc.yaml
```

Here’s what happens in each stage:

- **monitor_data:**
  - This stage is responsible for monitoring data quality and detecting any data
    drifts.
  - Executes `src/stages/monitor_data.py` with configuration parameters from
    `pipelines/monitor/params.yaml`.
  - Produces HTML reports for data drift and data quality, and stores them in a
    directory named as`reports/{predict.week_start}--${predict.week_end}`.
- **monitor_model:**
  - Focuses on monitoring the performance of the model and detecting any target
    drifts
  - Executes `src/stages/monitor_model.py` with configuration parameters from
    `pipelines/monitor/params.yaml`.
  - Generates HTML reports for model performance and target drift, saved in the
    specified monitoring reports directory names as
    `reports/{predict.week_start}--${predict.week_end}`.

## 📈 Data Validation and Model Monitoring with Evidently

Now, let’s explore how Evidently works internally as a part of an ML model
monitoring architecture.

### Metrics and Reports

The idea behind Evidently is very simple: it calculates a bunch of metrics and
organizes them into nice reports. Reports are the most effective way to analyze
and debug your models and data visually. You may save reports as HTML files,
JSON snapshots, or export the metrics externally by parsing JSON or Python
dictionary outputs. This allows you to apply Evidently for multiple validation
and monitoring scenarios in
[real-time](https://evidentlyai.com/blog/fastapi-tutorial) and
[batch-scoring](https://www.evidentlyai.com/blog/batch-ml-monitoring-architecture)
ML applications:

- save monitoring reports in HTML files and use them to analyze and debug your
  models and data,
- get values for specific metrics, and log them to external databases (like
  PostgreSQL) and dashboarding tools (like Grafana),
- save monitoring reports (as snapshots) in JSON files over time and run an
  [Evidently Monitoring Dashboard](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/monitoring/monitoring_overview)
  for continuous monitoring.

![Source: [https://docs.evidentlyai.com/](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/) ](../uploads/images/2024-01-19/9-evidently.png '=600')
_Source: [https://docs.evidentlyai.com/](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/)_

If you choose to use HTML and JSON files, you need a way to store and version
them. In the following section of the tutorial, we will explore how DVC can
assist with this.

### Data Requirements

To calculate metrics monitoring reports with Evidently, you typically need **two
datasets**:

- **Reference** dataset is a baseline for comparison or an exemplary dataset
  that helps generate test conditions. This can be training data or earlier
  production data. (from
  [docs](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/input-data/data-requirements))
- **Current** dataset is the dataset you want to evaluate. It can include the
  most recent production data. (from
  [docs](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/input-data/data-requirements))

![Original image: [https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/input-data/data-requirements](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/input-data/data-requirements) ](../uploads/images/2024-01-19/10-evidently-datasets.png '=600')
_Original image:
[https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/input-data/data-requirements](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/input-data/data-requirements)_

In this tutorial, the reference dataset is a sample extracted from the training
dataset. It helps to automatically generate a reference during the training and
align the version of the reference dataset and a model.

```python
# src/stages/evaluate.py

reference_data = train_data.sample(frac=0.3)
```

## 📈 Automate Data and Monitoring Pipelines with DVC

This section will guide you through the design and implementation of monitoring
pipelines, providing insights for the next improvements and customization.

### Separate DVC pipelines

In the tutorial example, we tried to achieve the following ML system design
principles:

- **Modular Design**: Each stage of the ML workflow, such as data preparation,
  model training, and monitoring, is encapsulated in separate DVC pipelines.
  This modular approach enhances maintainability and scalability.
- **Pipeline Independence**: These pipelines can be run independently, which
  allows for flexibility in execution and troubleshooting. In a typical
  scenario, training, inference, and monitoring pipelines run independently at
  different time intervals and environments.
- **Reusability**: By separating the pipelines, you can easily reuse components
  across different projects or stages of the same project.

As a result, the tutorial example has three pipelines for training, prediction
inference, and monitoring. DVC allows you to have multiple `dvc.yaml` files to
configure and run pipelines.

![Pipelines Directory Structure](../uploads/images/2024-01-19/10-pipelines-dir.png '=600')
_Pipelines Directory Structure_

Let’s explore an excerpt from the `pipelines/monitor/dvc.yaml` to discuss a few
“advanced” configuration features you may find useful:

```yaml
vars:
  - PIPELINE_DIR: pipelines/monitor

stages:
  monitor_data:
    cmd: python src/stages/monitor_data.py --config=${PIPELINE_DIR}/params.yaml
    wdir: ../..
    params:
      - ${PIPELINE_DIR}/params.yaml:
          - predict
          - monitoring
    deps:
      - src/stages/monitor_data.py
      - ${predict.predictions_dir}/${predict.week_start}--${predict.week_end}.csv
    outs:
      - ${monitoring.reports_dir}/${predict.week_start}--${predict.week_end}/${monitoring.data_drift_path}
      - ${monitoring.reports_dir}/${predict.week_start}--${predict.week_end}/${monitoring.data_quality_path}
```

- ☝️ **Using `vars`:**
  - Variables (`vars`) in DVC define values that can be reused across the
    `dvc.yaml` file. It makes complex `dvc.yaml` files more readable and easier
    to update.
  - In this example, `PIPELINE_DIR` is used to specify the pipeline directory in
    the project repository. You may reference this variable using the
    [templating](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/project-structure/dvcyaml-files#templating)
    format to insert values like `${PIPELINE_DIR}`.
- ☝️ **Using `wdir`:**
  - The `wdir` (working directory) key in `dvc.yaml` sets the directory context
    for running the commands defined in a stage. Allows you to use relative
    paths for dependencies (`deps`), outputs (`outs`), and scripts within that
    directory.
  - In this example, `wdir: ../..` points to the repository root. So, paths in
    `deps` and `outs` are easier to read and maintain.
- ☝️ **Using separate `params.yaml`:**
  - The `params.yaml` file holds parameters, and DVC allows it to have multiple
    ones.
  - This example has separate `params.yaml` file for each pipeline. To let DVC
    understand which file to use, we specify the full path to the `params.yaml`
    using the `PIPELINE_DIR` variable.

### Storing monitoring configuration in `params.yaml`

In some monitoring scenarios, you may have parameterized pipelines. Using DVC
you may find it useful to reuse `params.yaml` file to configure the monitoring
pipeline. This brings a few benefits:

- **Ease of Modification**: You can quickly adjust the pipeline's behavior by
  modifying the parameters in this file, such as changing the data source or
  tuning model parameters.
- **Version Control for Parameters**: Since `params.yaml` is under Git version
  control, changes in configurations are tracked by Git, ensuring
  reproducibility and transparency in your pipeline's evolution.

Let’s explore `pipelines/monitor/params.yaml`

```yaml
---
data:
  predict_data: data/test.csv
  target_col: cnt
  prediction_col: prediction
  numerical_features: ['temp', 'atemp', 'hum', 'windspeed', 'hr', 'weekday']
  categorical_features: ['season', 'holiday', 'workingday']

predict:
  model_path: models/model.joblib
  week_start: '2011-01-29'
  week_end: '2011-02-04'
  predictions_dir: data/predictions

monitoring:
  reports_dir: reports
  reference_data: data/reference_data.csv

  # for monitor_model
  model_performance_path: model_performance.html
  target_drift_path: target_drift.html

  # for monitor_data
  data_drift_path: data_drift.html
  data_quality_path: data_quality.html
```

- ☝️ **List features to be included in monitoring reports:**
  - `target_col` and `prediction_col` define the names of the target and
    prediction columns,
  - `numerical_features` and `categorical_features` define feature names for
    monitoring purposes. This could be especially beneficial for data monitoring
    and data drift reports.
- ☝️ **Parametrized data samples:**
  - `week_start` and `week_end` define the time frame for which predictions are
    generated. This example can be modified to support other approaches for data
    extraction.
- ☝️ **Specify a reference dataset:**
  - `reference_data` specifies a path to the reference dataset used in
    monitoring.
  - You may have multiple reference datasets and select among them to generate
    reports.
- ☝️ **Specify the location to store monitoring artifacts:**
  - `monitoring` section also specifies the location for monitoring reports.
  - You may update the reports directory or filenames in a single place. It’s
    handy!

### Log monitoring metrics with DVCLive and visualize them in VS Code IDE

[DVCLive](https://dvc.org/doc/dvclive) provides a Python API to log metrics,
plots, models, and other artifacts from code. Metrics and plots saved with
DVCLive can be automatically visualized in DVC extension for VS Code.

![Metrics in DVC Extension for VS Code](../uploads/images/2024-01-19/11-metrics-vscode.png '=600')
_Metrics in DVC Extension for VS Code_

Let’s explore an example of the `src/stages/evaluate.py` script to demonstrate
how DVCLive can help in DVC projects.

```python
from dvclive import Live
 ...
# Build a report
model_performance_report = Report(metrics=[RegressionPreset()])
model_performance_report.run(...)

# Extract metrics
regression_metrics: Dict = model_performance_report.as_dict()['metrics'][0]['result']["current"]
metric_names = ['r2_score', 'rmse', 'mean_error', 'mean_abs_error', 'mean_abs_perc_error']
selected_metrics = {k: regression_metrics.get(k) for k in metric_names}

# Save evaluation metrics with DVCLive
with Live(dir=str(REPORTS_DIR),
    dvcyaml=f"{pdir}/dvc.yaml",) as live:

    [live.log_metric(k, v, plot=False) for k,v in selected_metrics.items()]
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to log machine learning model performance
metrics calculated with Evidently using DVCLive. Here's a breakdown of what it
does:

1. `model_performance_report` is created using Regression Preset from Evidently.
2. The `model_performance_report` is executed with `.run(...)`, where the actual
   model evaluation and metric computation occur.
3. After `model_performance_report` building completes, you may parse the
   required metrics. In this example `selected_metrics` contains
   `['r2_score', 'rmse', 'mean_error', 'mean_abs_error', 'mean_abs_perc_error']`.
4. Live object context logs `selected_metrics` using `live.log_metrics()`
   method. There are few important arguments:
   1. `dir=str(REPORTS_DIR)` instructs DVCLive to save metrics to
      `reports/train` directory
   2. `dvcyaml=f"{pdir}/dvc.yaml` instructs DVCLive to use `dvc.yaml` for the
      `train` stage to add information about metrics files. The full path is
      `pipelines/train/dvc.yaml` .

### Versioning the Reference Dataset and Monitoring Reports

This example shows that DVC allows easily managed reference datasets for
monitoring purposes, and version monitoring reports themselves.

![Versioning reference datasets with DVC](../uploads/images/2024-01-19/12-versioning.png '=600')
_Versioning reference datasets with DVC_

There are a few benefits for versioning reference datasets and monitoring
reports with DVC:

- **Registry of Reference Datasets:** DVC helps store, version, and download
  datasets for monitoring purposes. You may need to download the reference
  dataset saved to cloud storage for a monitoring job in the production
  environment. DVC makes life easier!
- **Traceability**: This practice ensures traceability, allowing you to link
  model performance back to specific data versions.
- **Version Control of Reports**: You may want to manage all monitoring reports
  with DVC. It ensures a historical record of your model's performance and data
  quality.

## 🎨 Summing up

The combination of DVC and Evidently in automating data and monitoring pipelines
offers a structured and efficient approach to ML model management. This setup
enhances the reproducibility and reliability of your ML workflows and provides a
clear framework for monitoring and improving your models over time. With this
setup, you're well-equipped to maintain high-quality ML models responsive to the
dynamic nature of real-world data.

However, this tutorial covers only a single approach for DVC and Evidently
integration. We still working on other interesting scenarios and looking for
community support! Stay tuned!
