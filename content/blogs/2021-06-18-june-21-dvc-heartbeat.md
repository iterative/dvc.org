# From the Community

This month I'm going to take you on a thought provoking journey through some of
the content from our community.

![So many choices...](https://media.giphy.com/media/Uni2jYCihB3fG/giphy.gif)

## LJ Miranda's Triad of order

The MLOps tool landscape can be confusing to say the least.  
[LJ Miranda](https://twitter.com/ljvmiranda921), in a well written
[three-part series](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2021/05/10/navigating-the-mlops-landscape/)
lays out a framework for making sense of this space. The list of tools is not
exhaustive, but the framework and thought process for evaluating the tools is
intriguing. Additionally he encourages thinking about the skillset of the
members of your team within this framework to help you make decisions on the
right tools. It's not just about the tools, it's about the people!

As you can see DVC makes it into the "Trial" loop, but we think we will be be
making it into the adoption region in relatively short order. 😉🚀

Landscape_

## Found in the MLOps Community

You can find more comments from LJ Miranda and others in response to a
[great question](https://mlops-community.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC015J2Y9RLM%2Fp1622714574054300)
from André Godinho in the [MLOps Community](https://mlops.community/) Slack (see
below). If you're into MLOps and you're NOT a part of this Community, you should
be. You can join their Slack
[here](https://mlops-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-o96abp9z-sRYKWb96wGK9vdhUvbSrsQ#/shared-invite/email).

## Neda Sultova's Tutorial and Tool Rubric

Drilling down to the next level, I give you
[this tutorial](https://medium.com/geekculture/exploring-dvc-for-machine-learning-pipelines-in-research-part-1-3ebc2ca35a18)
by [Neda Sultova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neda-sultova-597a811a8/). Not only
is it a great tutorial of DVC in and of itself, but Neda also defines a clear
framework for the decision making process at
[Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/). Among the needs are reproducibility,
workflow integration, exchangeable backend, framework agnostic, open source, and
the ability of the solution to be tweaked to the team's needs.

## Our Philosophy

And at last I bring you to
["The Road to AI Hell Starts with Good MLOps Intentions" ](https://thenewstack.io/the-road-to-ai-hell-starts-with-good-mlops-intentions/)
by our CEO [Dmitry Petrov](https://twitter.com/FullStackML) which explains our
philosophy in the MLOps space. You will learn about the experiences that led to
developing our tools, what we think is the right way to solve MLOps challenges,
and how we do it.

> Teams made up of data scientists and developers should be able to define their
> own workflow based on their business requirements and team preferences, just
> like they do today when constructing any other software artifact. Rather than
> a platform forcing teams to embrace a highly opinionated workflow, they can
> employ flexible tools such Git, GitHub, and their existing CI tools as they
> see fit. - Dmitry Petrov

# Learning Opportunities

## R for DVC!

Are you or someone on your team an R user?
[João Santiago](https://twitter.com/jcpsantiago) who has contributed to DVC,
recently came up with "dvcru" to provide utility functions for DVC pipelines
using R scripts. Additionally the project aims to show typical workflows they
enable as well as provide project templates. Check out all the R goodness in
[this Github Repository](https://github.com/jcpsantiago/dvcru).

## Milecia McGregor at PyData SoCal

Next up we have [Milecia McGregor](https://twitter.com/FlippedCoding) presenting
and live coding at [PyData SoCal](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-SoCal/)
organized by [Pramit Choudhary](https://twitter.com/MaverickPramit). Check out
her talk on "Reproducible ML Experiments (with Git and DVC)" and all the great
questions that ensued.

## Dmitry Petrov at MLOps World

Finally we have [Dmitry Petrov's](https://twitter.com/FullStackML) talk at the
[MLOps World Conference](https://mlopsworld.com/) about machine learning in
production entitled "Data Versioning and ML Experiments on Top of Git."

# DVC News

We're still growing! Meet this month's new team members.

## New Team Members

[Jelle Bouwman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jelle-bouwman/) joins us from
Utrecht, Netherlands as a software engineer. He's worked as a consultant and at
an agency. He's most proud of
[the work he did with his team at the Port of Rotterdam](https://rotterdam.navigate-connections.com/voyages).
In his free time, Jelle loves reading fiction and books on human

Alexander joins us from Russia where he has been a Data Scientist/ML Engineer
for the last five years. He's also participated in many Kaggle competitions and
was ranked 5th in general competitions at some point! This led him to create a
Coursera course on
[how to win data science competitions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science)
about the tips and tricks needed to win one. Teaching is his passion and you
will probably see him producing some content in the near future. 🧑🏽‍💻

[Mikhail Sveshnikov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike0sv/) also joins us from
Russia where he formerly worked as a Data Engineer Team Lead for Rubbles. He

teaches Python and Big Data at HSE University. Finally he is one of the admins
of [ods.ai](https://ods.ai/) community, which creates global projects to unite
the community, promote Data Science, and help people develop their skills. In
his spare time he likes to play guitar, badminton, ski, and mix cocktails. 🍸
Cheers Mikhail!

[Jervis Hui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jervishui/) is joining the go-to-market
team at Iterative and is from NYC. He's worked in product marketing at various
