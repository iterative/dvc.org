**Need an easy way to run and track your experiments?** Install the DVC
extension from the
[VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iterative.dvc).
Then, run experiments, visualize deep learning metrics in real-time, compare
experiments, and save the ones you like - all from your IDE.

**Want to simplify your chaotic ML iterations?** With the DVC extension, you can
run reproducible workflows directly from VS Code.

To make it easy for you to create the workflows, the extension even
auto-generates code snippets.

**Tired of context switching throughout the day?** The integration of DVC with
VS Code empowers you to do everything from within your IDE. No more jumping from
notebooks to the terminal to IDE to web browsers to Git.

# Why a DVC extension for VS Code?

[DVC](https://dvc.org/) has helped individual ML developers and teams in
companies like UBS, DeGould, Exscientia, Kibsi and many more to standardize
their ML workflows on top of their cloud resources and Git repositories.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is, by far, the most popular IDE for all
developers, including ML engineers.

The DVC extension makes VS Code even more useful for you by providing you a VS
Code-native environment for managing your ML projects. You get the power of DVC
with capabilities beyond what's available in the terminal!

With over 34 thousand installs, the extension is proven to help you solve the
challenges of creating and managing your Machine Learning workflows.

# Getting started with the DVC extension for VS Code

To install the extension, open VS Code and search for "DVC" in the Extensions
view. Or install the extension from the
[VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iterative.dvc).

Now, create a DVC repository for your machine learning project and start
experimenting! Hereâ€™s how to do this:

To see all the DVC commands supported by the extension, open the DVC Command
Palette using F1 or â‡§âŒƒP on Windows/Linux or â‡§âŒ˜P on macOS and typing DVC.

# Itâ€™s always getting better!

Over the last one year, weâ€™ve made several enhancements in the DVC extension for
VS Code. For some of the interesting stuff you can do with it, watch the videos
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMYggTLm_-U&list=PL7WG7YrwYcnBo3ZBapzKNxtBcfNjGDQMM&index=5).
As a mark of the extension reaching a new level of maturity, today we have
launched it in
[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dvc-extension-for-vs-code). It
would be awesome if you check it out and leave us some feedback and support!

We are excited to see how the DVC VS Code extension helps you simplify your ML
workflows. For more information:
