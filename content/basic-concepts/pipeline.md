  DVC pipelines describe data processing workflows in a standard declarative
  YAML format ([`dvc.yaml`](/user-guide/project-structure/dvcyaml-files)). This
  guarantees DVC can reproduce them consistently. DVC also helps automate their
  execution and caches their results. See [Defining
  Pipelines](/user-guide/pipelines/defining-pipelines) for more details.
