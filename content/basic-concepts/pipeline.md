  DVC pipelines describe data processing workflows in a standard declarative
  YAML format ([`dvc.yaml`](/doc/user-guide/project-structure/dvcyaml-files)).
  This guarantees DVC can reproduce them consistently. DVC also helps automate
  their execution and caches their results. See [Defining
  Pipelines](/doc/user-guide/pipelines/defining-pipelines) for more details.
