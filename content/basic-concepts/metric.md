  Key/value pairs saved in structured files (JSON, TOML 1.0, or YAML 1.2) that
  map a metric name (AUC, ROC, etc.) to a numeric value. By specifying metrics
  files in `dvc.yaml`, DVC can compare them among machine learning experiments
  to evaluate machine learning performance. See `dvc metrics`.
